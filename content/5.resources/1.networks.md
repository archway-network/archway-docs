# Networks

This page provides a list of Archway networks and their configurations. Additionally, you can find information on all Archway networks and IBC related configurations by visiting the following GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/archway-network/networks" target="_blank">https://github.com/archway-network/networks</a>.

In addition to the resources provided by the core Archway team, developers can also leverage community-driven resources available within the Cosmos ecosystem. The [Cosmos chain registry](https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry/blob/master/archway/chain.json) allows service providers to submit their RPCs, APIs, gRPCs, and other resources that can be used by the public to interact with the Archway ecosystem. This ensures a diverse and decentralized set of resources for developers.

We encourage developers to explore and utilize these community-driven resources for their projects on the Archway network.
