## Torii (Community Testnet)

::alert{variant="warning"}
Archway core contributors will no longer run validators for the Torii network, so it's up to the community to keep the network alive. However, since we are no longer running validators for the network, there are no reliable public RPC endpoints available. Therefore, we have decided to remove the network from the Developer CLI as of v1.4.0.
#title
Removed from the Developer CLI
::

Community maintained testnet that has been used for completing incentivized testnet challenges. No incentivized challenge is active at the moment, and Torii will probably be deprecated in the coming future.
