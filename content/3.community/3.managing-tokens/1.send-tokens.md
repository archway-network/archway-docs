# How to send tokens

This guides shows how to send tokens across the blockchain by using different wallets.


Sending tokens on a blockchain means signing a transaction that transfers ownership of those tokens from your address to another.

Below you can see the guides on how you can send tokens using [Keplr](/community/wallet-setup/keplr-setup), [Cosmostation](/community/wallet-setup/cosmostation-setup), [Leap](/community/wallet-setup/leap-setup) or [Ledger](/community/wallet-setup/ledger-setup).

Please note that due to the characteristics of blockchains, **transactions are irreversible**. Make sure to always double-check the recipient address before submitting any transaction
