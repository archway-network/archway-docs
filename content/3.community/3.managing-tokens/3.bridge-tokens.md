# How to bridge tokens

Bridging tokens means to move them across different blockchain networks. Depending on the protocol or dapp, bridging tokens may be referred to as *importing / exporting* tokens, or as *depositing / withdrawing* tokens. 

## Bridging tokens via Archway Connect

<a href="https://connect.archway.io/" target="_blank">Archway Connect</a> is an effective tool to interact with the Archway protocol, and you can use it to deposit or withdraw tokens across different blockchains by using [IBC](/validators/running-a-relayer/introduction).

To bridge tokens, select the **Bridge** icon on the side menu:

You can withdraw or deposit tokens via IBC:

For example, you can then select tokens ticker and the network you want to withdraw the tokens to:

You can also check the enabled networks in the [IBC channels](/resources/ibc-channels) page.

Once you are ready to bridge the tokens, you can confirm the transaction on the Keplr wallet:

You are good to go!

You can deposit tokens using a very similar process, just by clicking on **Deposit**, instead of **Withdraw**.
