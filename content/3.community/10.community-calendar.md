# Community Calls

There are several community-driven initiatives which provide a space to propose ideas, learn, and interact with other community members.

1. **Builders Calls**

Builders Calls provide a space for developers to discuss about Archway's ADRs, make feature requests, interact and get support from Phi Labs teams. Builders Calls are also an opportunity for developers to share their latest projects and insights, as well as a collaborative way to troubleshoot challenges, foster collaborative learning and innovate. 

Builders Calls are Bi-Weekly and held on Wednesdays at 15:00 UTC. These calls happen on Discord at https://discord.com/events/892203409418092615/1233459489047318528.

2. **Governance Calls**

Engage in the decision-making process by participating in the Governance Calls. Delve into discussions about protocol upgrades, policy changes, and strategic planning. Being active in the Governance Calls is a key element for a fair and decentralized ecosystem
