Thank you for considering making contributions! 
We appreciate your interest in helping us to create and maintain awesome tutorials and documentation. :)

## Using the Archway docs repo

Review existing <a href="https://github.com/archway-network/archway-docs/issues" target="_blank">Archway issues</a> to see if your question has already been asked and answered.

- To provide feedback, file an issue, and provide generous details to help us understand how we can make it better.
- To provide a fix, make a direct contribution. If you're not a member or maintainer, fork the repo and then submit a pull request (PR) from your forked repo to the **develop** branch.
- Start by creating a draft pull request. Create your draft PR early, even if your work is just beginning or incomplete. Your draft PR indicates to the community that you're working on something and provides a space for conversations early in the development process.
<!-- Merging is blocked for `Draft` PRs, so they provide a safe place to experiment and invite comments.  -->

## Where can I find the tutorials and docs?

You can find the Archway docs in the <a href="https://github.com/archway-network/archway-docs/tree/main" target="_blank">Archway docs repository</a>

#### Developer docs:

_Developer docs_ refers to documentation for smart contracts and dApp developers. Its content helps users build and scale dApps on Archway network and contains information that is pertinent to:

- Smart Contract development
- Web and UI frontends that connect to Archway network
- The <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@archwayhq/cli" target="_blank">Archway developer CLI</a>

<!-- Developer docs are located in folder [/content/2.developers](https://github.com/archway-network/archway-docs/tree/main/content/2.developers) of the repository.
I am this as i'd rather have the specific link being written after the feature/rebrading branch gets pushed into main, to avoid broken links during reviews
-->

#### Developer guides (tutorials):

_Developer guides_ are tutorials for developing Archway smart contracts and dApps. Each guide includes step-by-step instructions and the final source code for a completed project to be run on Archway network.
<!--
Developer guides are located in the folder [/content/2.developers/6.guides](https://github.com/archway-network/archway-docs/tree/main/content/2.developers/6.guides)
I am this as i'd rather have the specific link being available after the feature/rebrading branch gets pushed into main, to avoid broken links during reviews

#### Node operator docs:

_Node operator docs_ refers to documentation relevant to operators of full nodes, local testnets, and to connecting nodes to public networks. This content is to help with setting up, configuring, monitoring and troubleshooting node instances.
<!--
Node operator docs are located in [/content/4.validators](https://github.com/archway-network/archway-docs/tree/main/content/4.validators).

## Viewing web app builds

There are two ways to see what your changes will look like in production before the updated pages are published.

- When a PR is ready for review, you can see a deployed preview on a URL that is unique to that PR.
- While a PR is in draft mode, you can preview a local build.


### **Preview draft PRs on a local web browser**

Since the deploy preview doesn't work on Draft PRs, follow these steps to preview a build of the Archway docs website on a local web browser. There are two ways to do it:
- Using <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" target="_blank">Node and npm</a>
- Using <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/" target="_blank">Docker</a>


#### **Using Node and Npm**
1. Clone the docs repo to your local machine and change it to that directory
   ::highlight-card

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:archway-network/archway-docs.git
   cd archway-docs
   ```

   ::


2. Using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank">npm</a>, install the repository's dependency modules
   ::highlight-card

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   ::

::alert{variant="info"}
For installing and maintaining multiple versions of **node** and **npm** you can use <a href="https://nvm.sh" target="_blank">nvm</a>
#title
Info
::

3. Start a local instance of the Archway docs website:
   ::highlight-card

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   ::
   


4.  You can now view the docs site in your web browser using the URL `http://localhost:3000/ `. 
Hot-reload is enabled. That means you won't need to stop and restart the server every time you make changes to the docs or code.

#### **Using Docker**

1. Clone the docs repo to your local machine and change it to that directory
   ::highlight-card

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:archway-network/archway-docs.git
   cd archway-docs
   ```

   ::




2. Install <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/" target="_blank">Docker</a>
.

3. Start Docker:

   ```bash
   sudo service docker start
   ```

  

4. Use Docker Compose to start the server:

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

   

5. You will see the website available on `http://localhost:3000`


### **Preview PRs on a deployed preview**

After the PR moves from **Draft** to **Ready for review**, the CI status checks will automatically generate a deploy preview. As you continue to work and commit new changes to the same branch, while the PR is open, the deploy preview will be kept up to date with your latest pushed change set.

To view a deploy preview on a **Ready for review** PR, click the preview link in the comment by the github-actions bot in the PR **Conversation** tab of the PR:

## Contribute to the Community Calls page

The process for contributing to the [Community Calls page](/content/3.community/10.community-calendar.md) is very similar to the above.

Here below, we summarize the steps to add the details for an upcoming Community Call.

1) Make sure you have a <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a> account.
2) Go to the <a href="https://github.com/archway-network/archway-docs/blob/main/content/3.community/10.community-calls.md" target="_blank">Community Calls page</a> on Github.
3) Press the *Edit* button ![](/images/docs/gh-collab.png)
4) Edit the file maintaining the  <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/" target="_blank">Markdown</a>  formatting. You can simply have a look at how the content of the *Weekly Builders Call* looks like, so that you can add your content in a similar way.
5) Press the *Commit Changes* button. ![](/images/docs/gh-collab-2.png)
6) Add the commit message and a description for the change.
7) Press on propose changes. A new branch is automatically created for the commit and a Pull Request is submitted. ![](/images/docs/gh-collab-3.png)
8) Wait for someone in the team to approve your PR.
9) Once the PR is approved and merged, wait for the new version of the docs to be released.
