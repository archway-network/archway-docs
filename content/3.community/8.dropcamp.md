# Archway Drop Camp

![](/images/docs/dropcamp.png)

Drop Camp is an on-chain reputation platform that scores campers based on both their off-chain and on-chain activity. This means that the more you participate in Archwayâ€™s ecosystem, the better your reputation gets. Campers that keep their reputation score up may earn campers airdrops targeting the Archway ecosystem. It can also enable campers to receive priority access to certain launches and initiatives within the community.

To take part in Drop Camp visit https://dropcamp.io.
