# Voting on governance proposals via archwayd


## Prerequisites

Make sure you have [archwayd](/developers/developer-tools/daemon) installed.

Query the governance proposals with:

::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd q gov proposals --node <rpc-endpoint> --chain-id <network-name>

```

::

For example, you can query the proposals with:




::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
mainnet

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd q gov proposals https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443 --chain-id archway-1
```


::

#title1
testnet

#desc1
::highlight-card


```bash
archwayd q gov proposals https://rpc.constantine.archway.tech:443 --chain-id constantine-3
```


::

::






Once you noticed the proposal's id you want to vote on, you can vote with:

::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd tx gov vote <proposal-id> <vote> --from <wallet> --node <rpc-endpoint> --chain-id <network-name>
```
::

For example, voting **yes** on the proposal **28** would be:






::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
mainnet

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd tx gov vote 28 yes --from mywallet --node https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443 --chain-id archway-1
```
::

#title1
testnet

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd tx gov vote 28 yes --from mywallet --node https://rpc.constantine.archway.tech:443 --chain-id constantine-3

```
