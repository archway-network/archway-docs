# Vote on a governance proposal
Voting for governance proposals is a key element for a healthy community, as token holders have a say in the decision-making process of the network.

## Why is voting so important?

There are several reasons why voting is so important, and we can condense them into two main elements.

### Representation

By voting, token holders are represented in the decision-making process. This ensures that decisions are made taking into account the views of the broader community, as token holders can help shape the future of the network.

### Network resilience

Governance proposals may be related to the security and stability of the network. For example, there may be proposals to increase the block reward, to introduce new features or to update the consensus algorithm. By voting in these proposals, you can help ensure that the network remains secure and reliable.

Voting in governance proposals also benefit decentralization by ensuring that the decision-making process is fair and transparent. This can help to prevent the network from being controlled by a small group of validators or by malicious actors that aim at manipulating the governance process for their own benefit.

## How to vote on governance proposals


You can vote either via <a href="https://connect.archway.io" target="_blank">Archway Connect</a>, [archwayd](../developers/developer-tools/daemon) or via a [wallet](wallet.md).


The easiest way to vote on governance proposals is through [Archway Connect](/community/archway-connect). However, you can also vote on governance proposals through a [wallet](wallet.md) or directly via [archwayd](../developers/developer-tools/daemon).


Note that: 

- By voting **YES**, you agree with the proposal and would like to see it passed.
- By voting **NO**, you disagree with the proposal and would not like to see it passed in its current state.
- By voting **ABSTAIN**, you are recognizing this proposal is irrelevant to you and would not want your vote to be counted in either direction.
- Voting **NO WITH VETO** By voting no with veto, you fundamentally disagree with the proposal and would not like to see it reworked nor revisited. 

### Voting on governance proposals via Archway Connect

### Voting on governance proposals via archwayd


#### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [archwayd](../developers/developer-tools/daemon) installed.

Query the governance proposals with:

::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd q gov proposals --node <rpc-endpoint> --chain-id <network-name>

```

::

For example, you can query the proposals with:




::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
mainnet

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd q gov proposals https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443 --chain-id archway-1
```


::

#title1
testnet

#desc1
::highlight-card


```bash
archwayd q gov proposals https://rpc.constantine.archway.tech:443 --chain-id constantine-3
```


::

::






Once you noticed the proposal's id you want to vote on, you can vote with:

::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd tx gov vote <proposal-id> <vote> --from <wallet> --node <rpc-endpoint> --chain-id <network-name>
```
::

For example, voting **yes** on the proposal **28** would be:






::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
mainnet

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd tx gov vote 28 yes --from mywallet --node https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443 --chain-id archway-1
```
::

#title1
testnet

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd tx gov vote 28 yes --from mywallet --node https://rpc.constantine.archway.tech:443 --chain-id constantine-3

```
