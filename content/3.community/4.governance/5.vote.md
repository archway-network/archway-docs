# Vote on a governance proposal
Voting for governance proposals is a key element for a healthy community, as token holders have a say in the decision-making process of the network.

## Why is voting so important?

There are several reasons why voting is so important, and we can condense them into two main elements.

### Representation

By voting, token holders are represented in the decision-making process. This ensures that decisions are made taking into account the views of the broader community, as token holders can help shape the future of the network.

### Network resilience

Governance proposals may be related to the security and stability of the network. For example, there may be proposals to increase the block reward, to introduce new features or to update the consensus algorithm. By voting in these proposals, you can help ensure that the network remains secure and reliable.

Voting in governance proposals also benefit decentralization by ensuring that the decision-making process is fair and transparent. This can help to prevent the network from being controlled by a small group of validators or by malicious actors that aim at manipulating the governance process for their own benefit.

## How to vote on governance proposals

You can vote either via <a href="https://connect.archway.io" target="_blank">Archway Connect</a>, [archwayd](../developers/developer-tools/daemon) or via a [wallet](wallet.md).

Note that: 

- By voting **YES**, you agree 
- By voting **NO**, you disagree
- By voting **ABSTAIN**, you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.
- Voting **NO WITH VETO** expresses that you would like to see depositors penalized by revocation of their proposal deposit

#### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [archwayd](../developers/developer-tools/daemon) installed.

Query the governance proposals with:

::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd q gov proposals --node <rpc-endpoint> --chain-id <network-name>

```

::

For example, you can query the proposals on Constantine with:

::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd q gov proposals https://rpc.constantine.archway.tech:443 --chain-id constantine-3
```

::



Once you noticed the proposal's id you want to vote on, you can vote with:

::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd tx gov vote <proposal-id> <vote> --from <wallet> --node <rpc-endpoint> --chain-id <network-name>
```
::

For example, voting **yes** on the proposal **28** on Constantine would be:
::highlight-card

archwayd tx gov vote 28 yes --from mywallet --node https://rpc.constantine.archway.tech:443 --chain-id constantine-3
