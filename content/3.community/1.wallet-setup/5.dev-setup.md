# Set up using the developer tools

Set up a wallet by using the developer tools, such as archwayd, archway cli and arch3js.


## Using the Archway Daemon

The command to add a new account using the **archwayd** daemon is:
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd keys add <account label>
```

::

Where <**account label**> represents a human-readable label for your account. Account labels help keep track of which account is which, especially pertinent if you're managing multiple Archway accounts.


Example account creation:
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd keys add mycoolwallet
Enter keyring passphrase:

- name: mycoolwallet
  type: local
  address: archway1cnfpa4n3pnrdfsrj3glmnq08u64mfmgu7nym9t
  pubkey: archwaypub1addwnpepqgr0thwj5f4yvmndeqzxw3fvc6avchgvkyufrm5uvmguqjys8zj4guqdpyh
  mnemonic: ""
  threshold: 0
  pubkeys: []


**Important** write this mnemonic phrase in a safe place.
It is the only way to recover your account if you ever forget your password.

# Mnemonic seed words here...
```

::
::alert{variant="info"}
After securing your mnemonic, you can delete your bash history to ensure no one can retrieve it.

```bash
history -c
rm -rf ~/.bash_history`
```

#title
info
::

Similarly, you can use the developer CLI (which is a wrapper of **archwayd**).

## Using the Developer CLI

Creating an account with the developer CLI is similar to using the daemon (**archwayd**), but has the benefit of making it easy to switch between Dockerized and native-built versions of Archway core. You can look at the archway CLI as a wrapper of **archwayd**, with additional functionalities for smoother use.
