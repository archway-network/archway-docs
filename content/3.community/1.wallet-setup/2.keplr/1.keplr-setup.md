### Keplr chain registry
In case you have already a Keplr wallet, you would need to add Archway by managing the chain visibility.

Begin by opening the Keplr extension window. Locate and click on the **menu** icon positioned at the upper left corner of the window:

This action triggers a menu that includes various options. Click "**Go to Keplr Chain Registry**" at the bottom on the window, which will guide you to a new webpage showcasing all available chains:

On the webpage, type "**Archway**" into the search bar. This action will produce a list of all related chains. From this list, identify the Archway chain that you want to add, and click the "**Add to Keplr**" link located to the right of the record. This action will open a window for you to approve the addition of the chain to Keplr. Click the "**Approve**" button to complete the action.

Upon completion, your Keplr wallet should now include Archway within its chain listing. Any tokens associated with the newly added chains will also be visible.

### Manage chain visibility

If the chain has already been added to Keplr, you still have the option to toggle the chain's visibility. Click the "**Menu**" icon at the top left of the Keplr window, and then select "**Manage Chain Visibility**". This will direct you to a webpage showcasing all chains that have already been added to Keplr.

On the webpage, type "**Archway**" into the search bar. This action will produce a list of all related chains. From this list, identify the Archway chain you want to show or hide, and then select the checkbox located to the right of the record. Finalize the process by clicking the "**Save**" button.
