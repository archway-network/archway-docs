Once your password is confirmed you will be required to save your **Recovery Phrase**. You will also need to verify this phrase in the next step. Please store this recovery phrase in a secure location and never share it with anyone, as this phrase gives full access to your wallet.

After confirming that you have saved the phrase, you will need to verify a few words within the phrase in their correct order.

Once verified, you will need to select the chains you wish to enable. "**All Chains**" is selected by default, which will enable all available chains within Frontier. You will then need to set a "**Name**" for your wallet and select a "**Wallet Color**".
