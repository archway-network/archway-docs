## Creating an account with Leap

A **Mnemonic Seed** phrase is generated specifically for your account. Use this phrase to recover your account in case your browser extension becomes corrupted or you forget your password. Make sure to store the seed safely and offline.

After having backed up the mnemonic, you are asked to fill it with the missing words.
