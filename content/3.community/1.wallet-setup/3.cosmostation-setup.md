# Set up using Cosmostation (mobile app)

A mobile app cryptocurrency wallet, like Cosmostation, is a software application designed for smartphones that allows users to manage, store, and interact with their cryptocurrencies. These wallets store users' private keys, enabling them to securely send, receive, and track their digital assets directly from their mobile devices.

Some pros of using a mobile app such as Cosmostation are:

- Portability and accessibility, allowing for easy access to funds on-the-go.
- Supports quick transactions using QR codes or contactless payments.
- Often features biometric security measures (e.g., fingerprint or facial recognition).

While some cons are:

- Less security than hardware wallets, as mobile devices can be vulnerable to hacking or malware.
- Reliance on a single device (the mobile phone).
- Less convenience for interacting with dApps compared to browser extensions.

## Creating an address with Cosmostation
If you want to set up a mobile app wallet, you can use <a href="https://wallet.cosmostation.io/cosmos" target="_blank">Cosmostation</a>. Your address for Archway's Testnets and Mainnet (when launched) will be automatically generated for your account once the respective network has been added to Cosmostation. Cosmostation is available both on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=wannabit.io.cosmostaion&pli=1">Google Play</a> and the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/cosmostation/id1459830339" target="_blank">Apple store</a>.

After having installed the app, you can open it and create a new address.



Select **Create** if you don't have an account already:

A **Mnemonic Seed** phrase is generated specifically for your account. Use this phrase to recover your account in case your browser extension becomes corrupted or you forget your password. Make sure to store the seed safely and offline.

Click on **Show Mnemonic**:
