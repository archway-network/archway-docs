# Create an Archway address using Ledger

A <a href="https://www.ledger.com/" target="_blank">Ledger</a> is a hardware cryptocurrency wallet, a physical device that securely stores users' private keys offline. It enables users to manage, store, and interact with their cryptocurrencies while providing a high level of security.

## Create an account with Ledger

When you first set up your Ledger device, you'll be prompted to create a new wallet or restore an existing one. During the setup, you'll generate a unique 24-word recovery phrase (also known as a mnemonic or seed phrase). This phrase is crucial for recovering your wallet and funds if you lose the device or need to reset it.

The 24-word mnemonic is generated and stored in the device, and it is compatible with Cosmos blockchains, so that accounts can be derived from it. 

1. Download the **Ledger Live** app
2. Connect your - <a href="https://www.ledger.com/" target="_blank">Ledger</a>Ledger via USB and update to the latest firmware
3. From the **Ledger Live** app store, download the _Cosmos_ (ATOM) application. 
4. Navigate to the **Cosmos** (ATOM) app on your Ledger device
