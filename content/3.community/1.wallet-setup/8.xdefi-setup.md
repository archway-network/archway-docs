# Set up xdefi wallet

This guide provides instructions on installing and setting up the XDEFI browser extension for use with the Archway network. Although the extension is compatible with both "**Google Chrome**" and the "**Brave**" browsers, this particular guide focuses on  Google Chrome.


## Install xdefi browser extension

Download the XDEFI browser extension from the <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/xdefi-wallet/hmeobnfnfcmdkdcmlblgagmfpfboieaf">Google Chrome Store</a>.

You will then be required to set a password to access your wallet.

Once your password is confirmed you will be required to save your **Secret Phrase**. You will also need to verify this phrase in the next step. Please store this secret phrase in a secure location and never share it with anyone, as this phrase gives full access to your wallet.

After confirming that you have saved the phrase, you will need to verify a few words within the phrase in their correct order.

Once verified, you will need to create a name for your wallet.

## Connecting to the Archway blockchain

To access the XDEFI wallet, click the "**Extension**" icon in your browser's toolbar and pin the XDEFI widget to the toolbar. After clicking the XDEFI icon, a widget should appear, prompting you for your password to log in.

Once logged into XDEFI, you should only see the XDEFI asset from the Ethereum chain. To add Archway assets click the "**Addresses**" button to add the "**Archway**" network.
