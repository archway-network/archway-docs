# Set up terra station wallet

This guide provides instructions on installing and setting up the Terra Station browser extension for use with the Archway network. Although the extension is compatible with "**Google Chrome**", "**Edge**" and the "**Brave**" browsers, this particular guide focuses on the Brave browser. For details on installing Terra Station on the Edge browser, as well as on mobile devices, visit https://setup-station.terra.money.

A new browser window is loaded where you will need to give the wallet a name and save the "**Recovery Phrase**". You will also need to verify this phrase in the next step. Please store this recovery phrase in a secure location and never share it with anyone, as this phrase gives full access to your wallet.

After confirming that you have saved the phrase, you will need to verify a few words within the phrase in their correct order.
