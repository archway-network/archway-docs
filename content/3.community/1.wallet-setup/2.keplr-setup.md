# Set up using Keplr (browser extention)

Keplr operates as a browser extension, meaning that it creates a secure environment within your browser to store your private keys and other sensitive information.

Using a browser extension wallet, you can perform all of the same functions as a traditional cryptocurrency wallet, including sending and receiving funds, viewing your transaction history, and managing your balances.


The pros of using a browser extension wallet are:

- Easy to use and convenient for interacting with web-based decentralized applications (dApps).
- Quick setup and access to funds.
- Works across multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) as long as the browser is supported.

The cons of using a browser extension wallet are

- Security risks associated with browser vulnerabilities or malicious extensions.
- Reliance on a single device (the one with the browser installed).
- Not as secure as hardware wallets for storing large amounts of cryptocurrency.


## Creating an address with Keplr
Your address for Archway's Testnets and Mainnet (when launched) will be automatically generated for your account once the respective network has been added to Keplr.
<a href="https://wallet.keplr.app/" target="_blank">Keplr</a> is a popular Cosmos wallet that is managed as a browser extension. For instructions on downloading, installing, and setting it up, see Keplr's [installation guide](https://keplr.crunch.help/getting-started/installing-keplr-wallet).

After installing the extension, open Keplr by selecting its icon from your browser toolbar. If you haven't created an account yet, you'll see a screen like this:

A **Mnemonic seed** phrase is generated specifically for your account. Use this phrase to recover your account in case your browser extension becomes corrupted or you forget your password.

When logged into Keplr with a valid account, the extension presents us with the following screen where we can view account balances and perform actions like sending payments or executing calls to smart contracts.
