# Create a new Wallet



New wallets can be created in different ways, including:


- [archwayd](/developers/getting-started/install#install-archwayd-using-docker) (archway core daemon)
- [Developer CLI](/developers/developer-tools/developer-cli)
- <a href="https://wallet.keplr.app/" target="_blank">Keplr</a>
- <a href="https://wallet.cosmostation.io/cosmos" target="_blank">Cosmostation</a>
- <a href="https://www.ledger.com/" target="_blank">Ledger</a>

## Using the Archway Daemon

The command to add a new account using the **archwayd** daemon is:
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd keys add <account label>
```

::
Where **<account label>** represents a human-readable label for your account. Account labels help keep track of which account is which, especially pertinent if you're managing multiple Archway accounts.

Example account creation:
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd keys add mycoolwallet
Enter keyring passphrase:

- name: mycoolwallet
  type: local
  address: archway1cnfpa4n3pnrdfsrj3glmnq08u64mfmgu7nym9t
  pubkey: archwaypub1addwnpepqgr0thwj5f4yvmndeqzxw3fvc6avchgvkyufrm5uvmguqjys8zj4guqdpyh
  mnemonic: ""
  threshold: 0
  pubkeys: []


**Important** write this mnemonic phrase in a safe place.
It is the only way to recover your account if you ever forget your password.

# Mnemonic seed words here...
```

::
::alert{variant="info"}
After securing your mnemonic, you can delete your bash history to ensure no one can retrieve it.

```bash
history -c
rm -rf ~/.bash_history`
```

## Using the Developer CLI

Creating an account with the developer CLI is similar to using the daemon **archwayd** , but has the benefit of making it easy to switch between Dockerized and native-built versions of Archway core. You can look at the archway CLI as a wrapper of **archwayd**, with additional functionalities for smoother use.


1. [install the archway CLI](/developers/getting-started/install#archway-developer-cli).



2. [Create a wallet with the Archway CLI](/developers/getting-started/setup#creating-an-account).


## Using a Browser Extension (Keplr)

### Creating an address with Keplr
Your address for Archway's Testnets and Mainnet (when launched) will be automatically generated for your account once the respective network has been added to Keplr.

[Keplr](https://wallet.keplr.app/) is a popular Cosmos wallet that is managed as a browser extension. For instructions on downloading, installing, and setting it up, see Keplr's [installation guide](https://keplr.crunch.help/getting-started/installing-keplr-wallet).

After installing the extension, open Keplr by selecting its icon from your browser toolbar. If you haven't created an account yet, you'll see a screen like this:

![](/images/docs/keplr02.png)

Select **Create new account** to see the following form:

![](/images/docs/keplr03.png)

A **Mnemonic Seed** phrase is generated specifically for your account. Use this phrase to recover your account in case your browser extension becomes corrupted or you forget your password.

![](/images/docs/keplr04.png)

When logged into Keplr with a valid account, the extension presents us with the following screen where we can view account balances and perform actions like sending payments or executing calls to smart contracts.

### Viewing and Switching between Cosmos tokens

Select the `Cosmos` dropdown on top of the window to switch the view to other Cosmos-based crypto tokens.

## Using a mobile app (Cosmostation)

### Creating an address with Cosmostation
If you prefer having a mobile app wallet, you can use <a href="https://wallet.cosmostation.io/cosmos" target="_blank">Cosmostation</a>. Your address for Archway's Testnets and Mainnet (when launched) will be automatically generated for your account once the respective network has been added to Cosmostation. Cosmostation is available both on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=wannabit.io.cosmostaion&pli=1">Google Play</a> and the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/cosmostation/id1459830339" target="_blank">Apple store</a>.

After having installed the app, you can open it and create a new address.



Select **Create** if you don't have an account already:

![](/images/docs/cosmostation_create.jpg){width=250}



A **Mnemonic Seed** phrase is generated specifically for your account. Use this phrase to recover your account in case your browser extension becomes corrupted or you forget your password. Make sure to store the seed safely and offline.

Click on **Show Mnemonic**:


![](/images/docs/cosmostation_seed1.png){width=250}

Save the mnemonic and press **Create Wallet**:

![](/images/docs/cosmostation_seed2.png){width=250}


### Viewing and Switching between Cosmos tokens
When logged into Cosmostation, you can add any Cosmos chains to your wallet. Your address for Archway's Testnets and Mainnet (when launched) will be automatically generated for your account once the respective network has been added to Cosmostation. Select the Cosmos address from the dropdown menu:

![](/images/docs/cosmostation_search_chain.jpg){width=250}

And add it to your wallet:

## Using a Hardware Wallet (Ledger)

When you initialize your Ledger, a 24-word mnemonic is generated and stored in the device. This mnemonic is compatible with Cosmos and Cosmos accounts can be derived from it. 

1. Download the _Ledger Live_ app
2. Connect your Ledger via USB and update to the latest firmware
3. From the _Ledger Live_ app store, download the _Cosmos_ (ATOM) application. 
4. Navigate to the _Cosmos_ (ATOM) app on your Ledger device

Great! Now you can either use your Ledger address with Keplr:

### Connect Ledger with Keplr

Here are the steps:

1. Make sure to close Ledger Live as it can conflict with Keplr.
2. Google Chrome is advised when using Keplr.
3. [Install Keplr](https://keplr.crunch.help/getting-started/installing-keplr-wallet)
Accessing your Ledger Cosmos account(s) via Keplr.
4. Connect your Ledger device to your computer and open the Cosmos app on your device.
5. Select the Keplr extension icon and select **Import Ledger**.
6. Use the Keplr extension to switch the networks.

### Use Ledger with archwayd

1. [Install the archway CLI](/developers/getting-started/install#archway-developer-cli)


2. Create your Archway address now by using Ledger with the **archwayd** daemon using the flag **--ledger**

The flag tells **archwayd** to use your Ledger to seed the account.
You may have to enable _Dev Mode_ in the settings of _Ledger Live_ to be able to download it.

   ::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd keys add <account label> --ledger
```

::
::alert{variant="warning"}
Creating Ledger accounts will only work if the Ledger is charged, plugged in, and unlocked.

<!-- ### Extras

Read on for extra tips and tricks for using your new account.

#### Transferring ARCH tokens

Here's how we can transfer `ARCH` tokens between accounts using the `archwayd` daemon.


```bash
archwayd tx send $(archwayd keys show ${SENDER_ACCOUNT} -a) $(archwayd keys show ${RECEIVING_ACCOUNT} -a) 12ARCH --fees 0.1ARCH --chain-id 'constantine-1'
```

Then, you should be prompted with the following confirmation question:

```json
{
  "body": {
    "messages": [
      {
        "@type": "/cosmos.bank.v1beta1.MsgSend",
        "from_address": "archway1gjllda936w6hu983pcy39m2gegfa29h6tyaezz",
        "to_address": "archway12zjz75hq3gmhc75pmcs9klc26mrhyvkueghy2l",
        "amount": [
          {
            "denom": "ARCH",
            "amount": "12"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "memo": "",
    "timeout_height": "0",
    "extension_options": [

    ],
    "non_critical_extension_options": [

    ]
  },
  "auth_info": {
    "signer_infos": [

    ],
    "fee": {
      "amount": [
        {
          "denom": "ARCH",
          "amount": "0"
        }
      ],
      "gas_limit": "200000",
      "payer": "",
      "granter": ""
    }
  },
  "signatures": [

  ]
}

confirm transaction before signing and broadcasting [y/N]: y
```

Enter `y` and hit the enter key.

Then we need to wait few moments for our transaction to go through. If things go well, we will see an output like this:

```json
{
  "height": "609",
  "txhash": "4F7AA2832D5190B68C5E4F2ABDC41B732BCCA582DCD27B0FD11898A3CBF48310",
  "data": "0A060A0473656E64",
  "raw_log": "[{\"events\":[{\"type\":\"message\",\"attributes\":[{\"key\":\"action\",\"value\":\"send\"},{\"key\":\"sender\",\"value\":\"archway1gjllda936w6hu983pcy39m2gegfa29h6tyaezz\"},{\"key\":\"module\",\"value\":\"bank\"}]},{\"type\":\"transfer\",\"attributes\":[{\"key\":\"recipient\",\"value\":\"archway12zjz75hq3gmhc75pmcs9klc26mrhyvkueghy2l\"},{\"key\":\"sender\",\"value\":\"archway1gjllda936w6hu983pcy39m2gegfa29h6tyaezz\"},{\"key\":\"amount\",\"value\":\"12ARCH\"}]}]}]",
  "logs": [
    {
      "events": [
        {
          "type": "message",
          "attributes": [
            {
              "key": "action",
              "value": "send"
            },
            {
              "key": "sender",
              "value": "archway1gjllda936w6hu983pcy39m2gegfa29h6tyaezz"
            },
            {
              "key": "module",
              "value": "bank"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "type": "transfer",
          "attributes": [
            {
              "key": "recipient",
              "value": "archway12zjz75hq3gmhc75pmcs9klc26mrhyvkueghy2l"
            },
            {
              "key": "sender",
              "value": "archway1gjllda936w6hu983pcy39m2gegfa29h6tyaezz"
            },
            {
              "key": "amount",
              "value": "12ARCH"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "gas_wanted": "200000",
  "gas_used": "61028"
}
```

Now let's check again the balance of our wallet:

```bash
archwayd query bank balances $(archwayd keys show my-wallet -a)
```
```yml
balances:
- amount: "12"
  denom: ARCH
pagination: {}
``` -->
