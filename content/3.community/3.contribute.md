Thank you for considering making contributions! 
We appreciate your interest in helping us to create and maintain awesome tutorials and documentation. :)

## Using the Archway docs repo

Review existing [Archway issues](https://github.com/archway-network/archway-docs/issues) to see if your question has already been asked and answered.

- To provide feedback, file an issue and provide generous details to help us understand how we can make it better.
- To provide a fix, make a direct contribution. If you're not a member or maintainer, fork the repo and then submit a pull request (PR) from your forked repo to the `develop` branch.
- Start by creating a draft pull request. Create your draft PR early, even if your work is just beginning or incomplete. Your draft PR indicates to the community that you're working on something and provides a space for conversations early in the development process.
<!-- Merging is blocked for `Draft` PRs, so they provide a safe place to experiment and invite comments.  -->

## Where can I find the tutorials and docs?

You can find the Archway docs in the <a href="https://github.com/archway-network/archway-docs/tree/main" target="_blank">Archway docs repository</a>

#### Developer docs:

_Developer docs_ refers to documentation for smart contract and dapp developers. It's content to help users build and scale dApps on Archway network and contains information that is pertinent to:

- Smart Contract development
- Web and UI frontends that connect to Archway network
- The <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@archwayhq/cli" target="_blank">Archway developer CLI</a>

<!-- Developer docs are located in folder [/content/2.developers](https://github.com/archway-network/archway-docs/tree/main/content/2.developers) of the repository.
I am this as i'd rather have the specific link being written after the feature/rebrading branch gets pushed into main, to avoid broken links during reviews
-->

#### Developer guides (tutorials):

_Developer guides_ are tutorials for developing Archway smart contract and dapp projects. Each guide includes step by step instructions and final source code for a completed project to be run on Archway network.
<!--
Developer guides are located in the folder [/content/2.developers/6.guides](https://github.com/archway-network/archway-docs/tree/main/content/2.developers/6.guides)
I am this as i'd rather have the specific link being available after the feature/rebrading branch gets pushed into main, to avoid broken links during reviews
-->

#### Node operator docs:

_Node operator docs_ refers to documentation relevant to operators of full nodes, local testnets and to connecting nodes to public networks. This content is to help with setting up, configuring, monitoring and troubleshooting node instances.
<!--
Node operator docs are located in [/content/4.validators](https://github.com/archway-network/archway-docs/tree/main/content/4.validators).

#### Validator docs:

_Validator docs_ refers to documentation relevant to operators of validator nodes, validator security and participating in validator rewards.
<!--
Validator docs are located in [/content/4.validators](https://github.com/archway-network/archway-docs/tree/main/content/4.validators).

## Viewing web app builds

There are two ways to see what your changes will look like in production before the updated pages are published.

- When a PR is ready for review, you can see a deployed preview on a URL that is unique for that PR.
- While a PR is in draft mode, you can preview a local build.


### **Preview draft PRs on a local web browser**

Since the deploy preview doesn't work on Draft PRs, follow these steps to preview a build of the Archway docs website on a local web browser. There are two ways to do it:
- Using <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" target="_blank">Node and npm</a>
- Using <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/" target="_blank">Docker</a>


#### **Using Node and Npm**
1. Clone the docs repo to your local machine and change to that directory
   ::highlight-card

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:archway-network/archway-docs.git
   cd archway-docs
   ```

   ::

2. Set up the <a href="https://www.algolia.com/" target="_blank">Algolia</a> API keys:
   In the `archway-docs`folder, create a `.env` file for the credentials:
   ::highlight-card

   ```bash
   cd archway-docs
   nano .env
   ```

   ::

   Paste the Algolia API keys in the `.env` file. They would look similarly to this:
   ```bash
   ALGOLIA_SEARCH_API_KEY="...."
   ALGOLIA_WRITE_API_KEY="..."
   ALGOLIA_APPLICATION_ID=
   ALGOLIA_INDEX="..."
   ```



3. Building the Archway docs website requires <a href="https://www.algolia.com/" target="_blank">Algolia</a> for JavaScript.

::alert{variant="success"}
For running <a href="https://nuxt.com/" target="_blank">Nuxt 3</a> we recommend using Node version 14 (fermium). 

For installing and maintaining multiple versions of `node` and `npm` you can use <a href="https://nvm.sh" target="_blank">nvm</a>
#title
Tip
::

4. Using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank">npm</a>, install the repository's dependency modules
   ::highlight-card

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   ::
   

5. Start a local instance of the Archway docs website:
   ::highlight-card

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   ::
   


6.  You can now view the docs site in your web browser using the URL `http://localhost:3000/ `. 
Hot-reload is enabled. That means you won't need to stop and restart the server everytime you make changes to the docs or code.

#### **Using Docker**

1. Clone the docs repo to your local machine and change to that directory
   ::highlight-card

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:archway-network/archway-docs.git
   cd archway-docs
   ```

   ::


2. Set up the <a href="https://www.algolia.com/" target="_blank">Algolia</a> API keys:
   In the `archway-docs`folder, create a `.env` file for the credentials:
   ::highlight-card

   ```bash
   cd archway-docs
   nano .env
   ```

   ::

   Paste the Algolia API keys in the `.env` file. They would look similarly to this:
   ```bash
   ALGOLIA_SEARCH_API_KEY="...."
   ALGOLIA_WRITE_API_KEY="..."
   ALGOLIA_APPLICATION_ID=
   ALGOLIA_INDEX="..."
   ```

3. Install <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/" target="_blank">Docker</a>
.

4. Start Docker:

   ```bash
   sudo service docker start
   ```

   ::   

5. Use Docker Compose to start the server:

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

   ::  

6. You will see the website available on `http://localhost:3000`


### **Preview PRs on a deployed preview**

After the PR moves from **Draft** to **Ready for review**, the CI status checks will automatically generate a deploy preview. As you continue to work and commit new changes to the same branch, while the PR is open, the deploy preview will be kept up to date with your latest pushed change set.

To view a deploy preview on a **Ready for review** PR, click the preview link in the comment by the github-actions bot in the PR **Conversation** tab of the PR:
