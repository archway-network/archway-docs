# Delegating via Archway Connect


## Prerequisites

Make sure to connect to <a href="https://connect.archway.io/" target="_blank">Archway Connect</a> by clicking on the button at the top right:

Make sure to have some tokens in your account.

## Delegating

First, click on the stake button on the side menu:

Then, choose a validator from the list of active validators, and click **Manage**:

You can select a validator to delegate to by clicking on the dropdown list:

Make sure not to delegate all your tokens, as you will need to pay transactions fees in case you want to undelegate.


Select the desired amount:

And approve the transaction in the Keplr wallet:

You are now staking, and you can see your delegation on the **Staking** section.


## Claiming the Staking Reward

Similarly to the previous step, go to the **Stake** section and click on the **Claim** button:

You can now approve the transaction in the Keplr wallet, and receive the pending rewards:

## Undelegate

Once you are in the **Stake** section, you can choose the validator you want to undelegate from and click on **Unstake**:

You can then review and confirm the transaction:

Please note that when undelegating in mainnet, your funds will be unavailable for 21 days. This delay allows the chain to be secure.


## Redelegate
Once you are in the **Stake** section, you can choose the validator you want to undelegate from and click on **Redelegate**:

You can select a validator to delegate to by clicking on the dropdown list:
![](/images/docs/archway_connect/connect-mainnet-10.png)


And the amount you wish to redelegate:
