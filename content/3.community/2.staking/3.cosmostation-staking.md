# Delegating via Cosmostation


## Prerequisites

Make sure to check the [wallet section](/community/wallet-setup/cosmostation-setup) and install <a href="https://wallet.cosmostation.io/cosmos" target="_blank">Cosmostation</a>. Afterwards, don't forget to deposit some tokens into your account.
## **Delegating**

First, click on the **Wallet** button on the bottom left, and then  open the Cosmostation app  and click on the **Delegate** button.

Then, choose a validator from the list and click on it:

Make sure not to delegate all your tokens, as you will need to pay transactions fees in case you want to undelegate:

and then confirm the transaction:

You are now delegating, and you can check the transaction on the block explorer (or just click on **Done**):

## Claiming the Staking Reward

Similarly to the previous step, click on the **Wallet** button on the bottom left, and then  open the Cosmostation app  and click on the **Delegate** button.

You will now see the validator you are delegating to. Press the **Claim all Rewards** button:

You will need to set the transaction fee:

and confirm the transaction.

## Undelegate

Once you are in the validator page (by clicking the **Wallet** button on the bottom left), click on the **Undelegate** button:

![](/images/docs/cosmostation_fees.jpg){width=250}

Choose now the amount you wish to undelegate:

Set up the fees, and then confirm the transaction. Please note that when undelegating, your funds will be unavailable for 21 days. This delay allows the chain to be secure.

Once you confirmed, you can either click on **Done** or look at the transaction in the blockexplorer:

## Redelegate
From the validator page, click on the **Redelegate** button:

![](/images/docs/cosmostation_redelegate.jpg){width=250}

Choose the amount you wish to redelegate:
![](/images/docs/cosmostation_redelegate.jpg){width=250}

And the validator you wish to redelegate to:
![](/images/docs/cosmostation_redelegate_val.jpg){width=250}

As always, select the amount of fees you wish to pay for the transaction to be processed:
![](/images/docs/cosmostation_fees.jpg){width=250}

Make sure you read the notice:
![](/images/docs/cosmostation_notice.jpg){width=250}


And confirm the transaction:
