# Delegating with the developer tools

You can delegate either by using the [archwayd](/developers/developer-tools/daemon) or the [developer CLI](/developers/developer-tools/developer-cli).

## Delegate via CLI

### **Requirements**

Install the [developer CLI](/developers/developer-tools/developer-cli) and [create a wallet](/community/wallet-setup/dev-setup)


### **Connecting to the network**

In order to delegate your stake you have to either [run your node](/validators/running-a-node/prerequisites) or you can connect to a trustworthy operator.

Malicious operators could return incorrect query results or censor your transactions. However, they will never be able to steal your funds, as your private keys are stored locally on your computer or ledger device. Possible options for full-node operators include validators, wallet providers or exchanges.

in order to connect to the network you need to: 

### **Config CLI**

If you are not running a node, you can configure your machine as a client.
First, remove any archway node data if there is any:
::highlight-card

```bash
rm -rf ~/.archway/*
```

::
You can set the default value for the node you are connecting to. If you want to connect to a node running on the **Constantine** network, you can use:





::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
mainnet

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd config node https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443

```

::

#title1
testnet

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd config node https://rpc.constantine.archway.tech:443

```

::

::













Finally, you can set up the chain ID of the network we want to interact with


::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
mainnet

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd config chain-id archway-1

```

::

#title1
testnet

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd config chain-id constantine-3

```

::

::

### **Send funds**

In order to delegate you need to send a **delegate** transaction to a validator by launching:
::highlight-card

```sh
archwayd tx staking delegate <validator-operator-address> <amount-to-bond> --from <your-key-name>
```

::




### **Find Validator's Operator Address**

You can query all the validators and pick the one we want to delegate tokens to it by launching:
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd query staking validators
```

::
::highlight-card

```yaml
pagination: {}
validators:
  - commission:
      commission_rates:
        max_change_rate: '0.100000000000000000'
        max_rate: '0.100000000000000000'
        rate: '0.010000000000000000'
      update_time: '2021-10-12T20:15:35.967858491Z'
    consensus_pubkey:
      '@type': /cosmos.crypto.ed25519.PubKey
      key: X1LGMAY8dToCgBuMIMpctn20Fwenim2YTGoY9Y2J+To=
    delegator_shares: '1000000000.000000000000000000'
    description:
      moniker: my-validator
    min_self_delegation: '1'
    operator_address: archwayvaloper14gxqxpxulxssv7pr4kltr9tl5dujtestxvjhkp
    status: BOND_STATUS_BONDED
    tokens: '1000000000'
    unbonding_time: '1970-01-01T00:00:00Z'
```

::
As you can see in the example, currently there is only one validator and its operator address is *archwayvaloper14gxqxpxulxssv7pr4kltr9tl5dujtestxvjhkp*
