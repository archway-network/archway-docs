# Delegating via Leap


## Prerequisites

Make sure to check the [wallet section](/community/wallet-setup/leap-setup) and install the <a href="https://www.leapwallet.io/#inpage-download" target="_blank">Leap wallet</a>. 

Make sure to have some tokens in your account, for example by using the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/892203409418092615/933050911662690334" target="_blank">Discord faucet</a>


## Delegating

First, click on the Leap browser extention, on your browser top bar,
![](/images/docs/leap-1-1.png){width=450}

and click on **Stake**.
![](/images/docs/leap-10-a.png){width=450}

Then, choose a validator from the list and click on it:

![](/images/docs/leap-12.png){width=450}
Make sure not to delegate all your tokens, as you will need to pay transactions fees in case you want to undelegate:


Review and confirm the transaction:

![](/images/docs/leap-13.png){width=450}

![](/images/docs/leap-14.png){width=450}

You are now staking, and you can see your delegation transaction should now appear in the **Activity** section:
![](/images/docs/leap-15.png){width=450}


## Claiming the Staking Reward

Similarly to the previous step, go to the **Stake** section:

![](/images/docs/leap-10-a.png){width=450}


and click on the **Claim** button:

![](/images/docs/leap-11-b.png){width=450}

You can now see the pending rewards:
![](/images/docs/leap-17.png){width=450}

and confirm the transaction to claim them.

## Undelegate

Once you are in the **Stake** section, click on **Unstake**:

![](/images/docs/leap-18-1.png){width=450}

Then choose the validator you want to undelegate from:

![](/images/docs/leap-18-3.png){width=450}

Choose the amount to undelegate:
![](/images/docs/leap-19.png){width=450}

Review and confirm the transaction:
![](/images/docs/leap-20.png){width=450}

You can now see the transaction in the **Activity** section:
![](/images/docs/leap-21.png){width=450}

Please note that when undelegating in mainnet, your funds will be unavailable for 21 days. This delay allows the chain to be secure.


## Redelegate
Once you are in the **Stake** section, click on **Switch Validator**:

![](/images/docs/leap-18-2.png){width=450}

Then choose the validator you want to redelegate from:

![](/images/docs/leap-18-3.png){width=450}

Choose the validator you wish to redelegate to:
![](/images/docs/leap-22.png){width=450}

And the amount you wish to redelegate:

![](/images/docs/leap-23.png){width=450}


Review and confirm the transaction:

![](/images/docs/leap-24.png){width=450}
You can now see the transaction in the **Activity** section:

![](/images/docs/leap-25.png){width=450}
