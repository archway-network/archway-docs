# Monitoring validators

There is a <a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank" >Grafana</a> dashboard that is compatible with all the <a href="https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk" target="_blank" >cosmos-sdk</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint" target="_blank" >tendermint</a> based blockchains.

## Preview

Let's set it up for our network.

## Prerequisites

First install <a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank" >Grafana</a> and <a href="https://prometheus.io/" target="_blank" >Prometheus</a> on your machine.

## Enable tendermint metrics

You will need to edit the node's `config/config.toml` file, setting `prometheus` to `true`:

::highlight-card

```bash
sed -i 's/prometheus = false/prometheus = true/g' <YOUR-NODE-HOMEDIR>/config/config.toml
```

::

In order for the change to take effect you will need to restart the node. You should be able to access the `tendermint` metrics which defaults to port **26660**: <http://localhost:26660>

## Configure prometheus targets

Find `prometheus.yml` file and append the following `job` under the `scrape_configs`:

```yaml
- job_name: archway
  static_configs:
    - targets: ['localhost:26660']
      labels:
        instance: validator
```

On linux machines this file can be found under this path: `/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml`

## Resolving port conflicts

When both **archwayd** and **prometheus** are running on the same machine, one of the service will encounter a port conflict, causing it to be unable to execute. Do the following to resolve this issue.

Open the node's **config/app.toml** file and look for:

```toml
[grpc]
address = "0.0.0.0:9090"
```

Change the port to something else:

```toml
[grpc]
address = "0.0.0.0:9095"
```

## Restart prometheus and archwayd

Restart **archwayd** using the followng:

::highlight-card

```bash
sudo archwayd stop
sudo archwayd start
```

::

The you can restart **prometheus**:

::highlight-card

```bash
sudo service prometheus restart
```

::


## Adding a prometheus service file (Optional)

A service file can be used to allow for the automatic restart of the service, helping to make sure that your node is always monitored.

You can create a service file with:

::highlight-card

```bash
nano /etc/systemd/system/prometheus_s.service

```

::


Add the following content to the file:

::highlight-card

```service
[Unit]
Description=Prometheus
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target
[Service]
User=$USER
Type=simple
ExecStart=/home/$USER/prometheus/prometheus \
--config.file /home/$USER/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
--storage.tsdb.path /home/$USER/prometheus/ \
--web.console.templates=/home/$USER/prometheus/consoles \
--web.console.libraries=/home/$USER/prometheus/console_libraries
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=4096
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```

::

You can then reload the **systemctl** daemon:

::highlight-card

```bash

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

::

Then enable the service:

::highlight-card

```bash

sudo -S systemctl enable prometheus
```

::

Start prometheus as a service:

::highlight-card

```bash
sudo systemctl start prometheus
```

::

You can then check that the service is properly running with:

::highlight-card

```bash

sudo systemctl status prometheus
```

::

You can now check the status of the **prometheus** service by running:
::highlight-card

```bash
systemctl status prometheus.service
```

::

If you see some output like the following, it means the service is running without an issue:

```

```


## Configure grafana

If you have grafana installed on your node, you can access it via navigating to this address: <http://localhost:3000>

The default username and password is `admin`.

Click on **config**, then add a data source.

Select Prometheus from the list and add its URL.

If you have installed it on your node, the default URL is: <http://localhost:9090>

Click on `Save & test` to make sure everything is alright.

## Import grafana dashboard

Copy and paste the <a href="https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/11036" target="_blank" >Grafana Dashboard ID</a>`11036` and click on `Load` to complete importing.

Now you should be able to monitor your validator node.
