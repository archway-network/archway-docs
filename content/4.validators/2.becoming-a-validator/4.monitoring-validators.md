# Monitoring Validators

There is a <a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank" >Grafana</a> dashboard compatible with all the <a href="https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk" target="_blank" >cosmos-sdk</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint" target="_blank" >tendermint</a>-based blockchains.

## Preview

![](/images/docs/cosmos-overview.jpg)

Let's set it up for our network.

## Prerequisites

First install <a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank" >Grafana</a> and <a href="https://prometheus.io/" target="_blank" >Prometheus</a> on your machine.

## Enable Tendermint Metrics

::highlight-card

```bash
sed -i 's/prometheus = false/prometheus = true/g' <YOUR-NODE-HOMEDIR>/config/config.toml
```

::
After restarting your node, you should be able to access the `tendermint` metrics(default port is 26660): <http://localhost:26660>

## Configure Prometheus Targets

Find `prometheus.yml` file and append the following `job` under the `scrape_configs`:

```yaml
- job_name: archway
  static_configs:
    - targets: ['localhost:26660']
      labels:
        instance: validator
```

::alert{variant="info"}
On linux machines this file can be found under this path: `/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml`

## Resolving Port Conflicts

If you run your `archway` network and `Prometheus` on the same machine, you will see one of them cannot run due to a port conflict. Let's resolve it.

**Open the `./node-main/config/app.toml` file and look for**

```toml
[grpc]
address = "0.0.0.0:9090"
```

Then change the port to something else like this:

```toml
[grpc]
address = "0.0.0.0:9095"
```

## Restart Prometheus

::highlight-card

```bash
sudo service prometheus restart
```

::
Check the status if the prometheus service is running properly:
::highlight-card

```bash
systemctl status prometheus.service
```

::

If you see some output like this, it means it is running without an issue:

```

     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/prometheus.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Wed 2021-10-06 15:32:48 CEST; 17min ago

     Memory: 48.3M
     CGroup: /system.slice/prometheus.service
             └─457917 /usr/bin/prometheus
```


## Adding a Prometheus service file (Optional)



A service file can be used to allow the automatic restart of the service, helping to make sure that your node is always monitored.

You can create a service file with:

::highlight-card

```bash
nano /etc/systemd/system/prometheus_s.service

```

::




And add the following content to the file:

::highlight-card

```service
[Unit]
Description=Prometheus
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target
[Service]
User=$USER
Type=simple
ExecStart=/home/$USER/prometheus/prometheus \
--config.file /home/$USER/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
--storage.tsdb.path /home/$USER/prometheus/ \
--web.console.templates=/home/$USER/prometheus/consoles \
--web.console.libraries=/home/$USER/prometheus/console_libraries
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=4096
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```

::

You can then reload the systemctl daemon:
::highlight-card

```bash

sudo -S systemctl daemon-reload
```

::

Enable the  service:

::highlight-card

```bash

sudo -S systemctl enable prometheus_s.service
```

::

And then start Prometheus as a service:

::highlight-card

```bash

sudo systemctl start prometheus_s.service
```

::


You can then check that the service is properly running with:
::highlight-card

```bash

sudo systemctl status prometheus_s.service
```

::


## Configure Grafana

if you have grafana installed on your machine, you can access it via navigating to this address: <http://localhost:3000>

The default username and password is `admin`.

Click on config, then add a data source.

Then select Prometheus from the list and add its URL.

![](/images/docs/grafana02.png)
If you have installed it on your machine, the default URL is: <http://localhost:9090>

Click on `Save & test` to make sure everything is alright.

## Import Grafana Dashboard

Copy and paste the <a href="https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/11036" target="_blank" >Grafana Dashboard ID</a>`11036` and click on `Load` to complete importing.

Now you should be able to monitor your validator node.
