# What is cosmovisor?

<a href="https://docs.cosmos.network/main/tooling/cosmovisor" target="_blank" >Cosmovisor</a> is a process manager designed specifically for managing Cosmos SDK-based blockchains, and it enables seamless and automated software upgrades (without downtime). This is particularly important for validators, who need to ensure their nodes are always up-to-date and operational to avoid slashing.

In essence, Cosmovisor provides for automated processes to handle upgrades, reducing downtime or manual intervention.

## Install cosmovisor

First, make sure to have looked into the [prerequisites](/validators/running-a-node/prerequisites), [installation](/validators/running-a-node/install), and [keys](/validators/running-a-node/keys) sections.



Install Cosmovisor with:

::highlight-card

```bash
go install github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/cosmovisor/cmd/cosmovisor@latest
```

::

and check that the installation has been successful with:

::highlight-card

```bash
cosmovisor
```

::

## Configure cosmovisor

First, create the required directories by executing the following commands:

::highlight-card

```bash
mkdir -p "${HOME}"/.archway/cosmovisor/genesis/bin
mkdir "${HOME}"/.archway/cosmovisor/upgrades
```

::


Then copy the **archwayd** binary to the **genesis/bin** folder:

::highlight-card

```bash
cp "${GOPATH}"/bin/archwayd "${HOME}"/.archway/cosmovisor/genesis/bin
```

::


Add the necessary environment variables, for example by adding these variables to the profile that will be running Cosmovisor. You can edit the **~/.profile** file by adding the following content:


::highlight-card

```bash
export DAEMON_HOME="${HOME}"/.archway
export DAEMON_RESTART_AFTER_UPGRADE=true
export DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES=true
export DAEMON_NAME=archwayd
export UNSAFE_SKIP_BACKUP=true
```

::


## Run cosmovisor as a service

Before running Cosmovisor, you should make sure to have [initialized your archway node](/validators/running-a-node/install##initialize-a-node) and looked into the [joining a network](/validators/running-a-node/join-a-network/overview) section to download the genesis file, the snapshot and set up the persistent peers.

You can create a service file with:

::highlight-card

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/cosmovisor.service
```

::

and add the following content by making sure to change the <**your-user**>, <**path-to-cosmovisor**> and <**path-to-archway**> with your values:


::highlight-card

```bash
[Unit]
Description=cosmovisor
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=<your-user>
ExecStart=/<path-to-cosmovisor>/cosmovisor start --x-crisis-skip-assert-invariants
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=4096
Environment="DAEMON_NAME=archwayd"
Environment="DAEMON_HOME=/<path-to-archway>/.archway"
Environment="DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES=false"
Environment="DAEMON_RESTART_AFTER_UPGRADE=true"
Environment="DAEMON_LOG_BUFFER_SIZE=512"
Environment="UNSAFE_SKIP_BACKUP=true"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```

::


You can now reload the **systemctl** daemon:

::highlight-card

```bash
sudo -S systemctl daemon-reload
```

::


and enable Cosmovisor as a service:

::highlight-card

```bash
sudo -S systemctl enable cosmovisor
```

::

You can now start Cosmovisor by executing:

::highlight-card

```bash
sudo systemctl start cosmovisor
```

::


Make sure to check that the service is running by executing:

::highlight-card

```bash
sudo systemctl status cosmovisor
```

::
