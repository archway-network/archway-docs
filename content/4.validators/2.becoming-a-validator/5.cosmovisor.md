# What is cosmovisor?

<a href="https://docs.cosmos.network/main/tooling/cosmovisor" target="_blank" >Cosmovisor</a> is a powerful utility for managing the binary version of Cosmos SDK-based chains. Its primary function is to enable seamless binary upgrades without requiring a full node restart or manual intervention. In essence, Cosmovisor provides for automated processes to handle upgrades, reducing downtime or manual intervention.

Even when automatic upgrades are not enabled, Cosmovisor remains a valuable tool for managing different versions of the **archwayd** binary. It simplifies the process of managing different versions of the binary by automatically switching to the appropriate binary version based on the block height. This helps reduce potential errors or missed upgrades during the manual process, allowing validators to maintain their nodes with greater ease and accuracy.

While Cosmovisor can **also** automate the process of downloading and installing new binaries, it's important to note that node operators bear the responsibility of ensuring the binaries they are running are trustworthy. Therefore, even when using Cosmovisor, it is recommended for operators to remain vigilant of upgrade proposals and verify new binaries independently.

In cases where a node operator prefers or requires a greater degree of control, manual upgrades are preferable.


::alert{variant="warning"}
For security reasons, enabling automatic upgrades are intended only for simple nodes (and not validators). For validators, it is recommended to run cosmovisor with *DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES = false*.

## How does cosmovisor work?
Cosmovisor is designed to be used as an abstract interface for the Cosmos SDK chain, for example Archway.
Some key takeaways about Cosmovisor:
- it passes arguments to **archwayd** (which is configured by **DAEMON_NAME** env variable). 
- It manages **archwayd** by restarting and upgrading if needed.
- It is configured using environment variables, not positional arguments.
- Running **cosmovisor run arg1 arg2** .... runs **archwayd arg1 arg2** ...
- All arguments passed to **cosmovisor** run are passed to the application binary, as a subprocess. As **cosmovisor** returns **/dev/stdout** and **/dev/stderr** of the subprocess as its own, **cosmovisor run** cannot accept any command-line arguments other than those available to **archwayd**.


Make sure to check the <a href="https://docs.cosmos.network/main/tooling/cosmovisor" target="_blank" >cosmovisor documentation</a> for a comprehensive guide on how to use Cosmovisor.

## Environment variables
Cosmovisor reads its configuration from environment variables:

- **DAEMON_HOME** is the location where the **cosmovisor/ directory** is kept that contains the genesis binary, the upgrade binaries, and any additional auxiliary files associated with each binary.
- **DAEMON_NAME** is the name of the binary itself.
- **DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES** (optional), if set to true, will enable auto-downloading of new binaries. By default, cosmovisor will not auto-download new binaries. If running a validator, it is recommended to set this variable to
- **DAEMON_RESTART_AFTER_UPGRADE** (optional, **default = true**), if true, restarts the subprocess with the same command-line arguments and flags (but with the new binary) after a successful upgrade. Otherwise (**false**), cosmovisor stops running after an upgrade and requires the system administrator to manually restart it. Note restart is only after the upgrade and does not auto-restart the subprocess after an error occurs.


## Install cosmovisor

First, make sure to have looked into the [prerequisites](/validators/running-a-node/prerequisites), [installation](/validators/running-a-node/install), and [keys](/validators/running-a-node/keys) sections.



Install Cosmovisor with:

::highlight-card

```bash
go install github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/cosmovisor/cmd/cosmovisor@latest
```

::

and check that the installation has been successful with:

::highlight-card

```bash
cosmovisor
```

::

## Configure cosmovisor

First, create the required directories by executing the following commands:

::highlight-card

```bash
mkdir -p "${HOME}"/.archway/cosmovisor/genesis/bin
mkdir "${HOME}"/.archway/cosmovisor/upgrades
```

::


Then copy the **archwayd** binary to the **genesis/bin** folder:

::highlight-card

```bash
cp "${GOPATH}"/bin/archwayd "${HOME}"/.archway/cosmovisor/genesis/bin
```

::


Add the necessary environment variables, for example by adding these variables to the profile that will be running Cosmovisor. You can edit the **~/.profile** file by adding the following content:


::highlight-card

```bash
export DAEMON_HOME="${HOME}"/.archway
export DAEMON_RESTART_AFTER_UPGRADE=true
export DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES=true
export DAEMON_NAME=archwayd
export UNSAFE_SKIP_BACKUP=true
```

::


## Run cosmovisor as a service

Before running Cosmovisor, you should make sure to have [initialized your archway node](/validators/running-a-node/install##initialize-a-node) and looked into the [joining a network](/validators/running-a-node/join-a-network/overview) section to download the genesis file, the snapshot and set up the persistent peers.

You can create a service file with:

::highlight-card

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/cosmovisor.service
```

::

and add the following content by making sure to change the <**your-user**>, <**path-to-cosmovisor**> and <**path-to-archway**> with your values:


::highlight-card

```bash
[Unit]
Description=cosmovisor
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=<your-user>
ExecStart=/<path-to-cosmovisor>/cosmovisor start --x-crisis-skip-assert-invariants
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=4096
Environment="DAEMON_NAME=archwayd"
Environment="DAEMON_HOME=/<path-to-archway>/.archway"
Environment="DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES=false"
Environment="DAEMON_RESTART_AFTER_UPGRADE=true"
Environment="DAEMON_LOG_BUFFER_SIZE=512"
Environment="UNSAFE_SKIP_BACKUP=true"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```

::


You can now reload the **systemctl** daemon:

::highlight-card

```bash
sudo -S systemctl daemon-reload
```

::


and enable Cosmovisor as a service:

::highlight-card

```bash
sudo -S systemctl enable cosmovisor
```

::

You can now start Cosmovisor by executing:

::highlight-card

```bash
sudo systemctl start cosmovisor
```

::


Make sure to check that the service is running by executing:

::highlight-card

```bash
sudo systemctl status cosmovisor
```

::
