# Perform a chain upgrade

Upgrading your node during soft forks and hard forks, as well as when using [Cosmovisor](/validators/becoming-a-validator/cosmovisor) or not, may involve different processes. Here are the key differences between these scenarios:

## Soft forks vs. hard forks

- **Soft Forks:** During a soft fork, the upgrade is backward-compatible, meaning that nodes running the old version can still communicate and validate new blocks with nodes running the new version. For a soft fork, you typically need to download, verify, and extract the new binary, and then restart your node. If you are using Cosmovisor, it will handle the binary upgrade automatically when the specified block height is reached.

- **Hard Forks:** A hard fork implies that the upgrade is not backward-compatible, and all nodes must upgrade to the new version to continue operating. In addition to updating the binary, a hard fork requires you to replace the existing genesis file with a new one. The new genesis file can be found in the network's documentation or release notes. After updating the genesis file and the binary, you need to restart your node.

## Using cosmovisor vs. not using cosmovisor

- **Using Cosmovisor:** Cosmovisor is an upgrade manager for Cosmos SDK-based blockchains. It automatically downloads and switches to the new binary when the specified block height for the upgrade is reached. This means that, as a node operator, you do not need to manually manage the upgrade process. However, for hard forks, you will still need to replace the genesis file manually.

- **Not Using Cosmovisor:** If you are not using Cosmovisor, you are responsible for manually managing the upgrade process. This involves downloading, verifying, and extracting the new binary, and restarting the node once the specified block height is reached. For hard forks, you will also need to replace the genesis file manually.

This guide provides a step-by-step process for performing chain upgrades on the Archway Network during soft forks and hard forks, whether you're using Cosmovisor or not.

## Soft forks

### With cosmovisor

Cosmovisor automates the binary upgrade process for soft forks, so you won't need to manually manage it.

- Monitor the upgrade details on <a href="https://discord.gg/archwayhq" target="_blank">Discord</a> or keep abreast of upgrade proposals via the [block explorer](/resources/blockexplorers) for the respective network to stay updated on the exact block height for the upgrade and any additional steps required.

- Cosmovisor will automatically switch to the new binary when the specified block height is reached.

### With cosmovisor (manual download)

- Monitor the upgrade details on <a href="https://discord.gg/archwayhq" target="_blank">Discord</a> or keep abreast of upgrade proposals via the [block explorer](/resources/blockexplorers) for the respective network to stay updated on the exact block height for the upgrade and any additional steps required.

- Download the updated binary by following the instructions below:

To Download the updated binary, create a directory with the name corresponding to the version number of archwayd being upgraded to (e.g., 0.x.y):


::highlight-card
```bash
mkdir -p "${HOME}"/.archwayd/upgrades/0.x.y/bin
```
::

Navigate to the new directory and download the new release:

::highlight-card
```bash
cd "${HOME}"/.archwayd/upgrades/0.x.y/bin
wget -O archway.zip https://github.com/ArchwayNetwork/archway/releases/download/v0.x.y/archwayd-v0.x.y-linux-amd64.zip
```
::

Verify the download: Each release has an associated SHA256 file to verify that the downloaded file is correct. Generate the SHA256 hash for the downloaded file using:

::highlight-card
```bash
sha256sum archway.zip
```
::

Download the SHA256 file connected to the release file:

::highlight-card
```bash
wget -O archwaysha256.txt https://github.com/ArchwayNetwork/archway/releases/download/v0.x.y/archwayd-v0.x.y-linux-amd64.zip.sha256

```
::

Compare both SHA256 hash strings, and if they match, the downloaded file matches the actual release file.


Extract the binary: Unzip the binary in the "${HOME}"/.archwayd/upgrades/0.x.y/bin folder using:

::highlight-card
```bash
unzip archway.zip
```
::

Stop the node: Stop your node before the specified block height is reached:

::highlight-card
```bash
sudo systemctl stop archwayd
```
::

Replace the old binary: Replace the old binary with the new one:

::highlight-card
```bash
cp "${HOME}"/.archwayd/upgrades/0.x.y/bin/archwayd /usr/local/bin/

```
::


Restart the node: Restart your node to complete the process:

::highlight-card
```bash
sudo systemctl start archwayd

```
::

## Hard forks

The process for hard forks is similar to soft forks but includes additional steps for replacing the genesis file.

### With cosmovisor

- Follow the steps from the [Soft Forks with Cosmovisor](#soft-forks) section to monitor the upgrade details and let Cosmovisor handle the binary upgrade.

- [Replace the genesis file](#replace-the-genesis-file).

### With cosmovisor (manual download)

- Monitor the upgrade details on <a href="https://discord.gg/archwayhq" target="_blank">Discord</a> or keep abreast of upgrade proposals via the [block explorer](/resources/blockexplorers) for the respective network to stay updated on the exact block height for the upgrade and any additional steps required.

Follow the steps in the [Soft Forks without Cosmovisor](#soft-forks):

- Download the updated binary.

- Verify the download.

- Extract the binary.

- Replace the binary.

In addition to the above, you should also [replace the genesis file](#replace-the-genesis-file).



## Replace the genesis file

First, download the new genesis file to your local machine. The genesis file for each respective network can be found on the [Networks](/resources/networks) page.

Before replacing the current genesis file, it's good practice to create a backup. Navigate to the directory containing the genesis file (usually located in the config folder) and create a backup:

::highlight-card
```bash
cd ~/.archwayd/config
cp genesis.json genesis.json.backup

```
::

Replace the current genesis file with the new one you downloaded earlier. Assuming you have downloaded the new genesis file as **new-genesis.json**, you can replace the existing file using the following command:

::highlight-card
```bash
cp /path/to/new-genesis.json ~/.archwayd/config/genesis.json

```
::


Make sure to replace **/path/to/new-genesis.json** with the actual path to the new genesis file.

Since it's a hard fork, you'll need to reset your node's data to start with the new genesis file. You can do this using the following command:

::highlight-card
```bash
archwayd unsafe-reset-all
```
::


If you have already updated the binary (either manually or through Cosmovisor), you can now restart your node to complete the process:

::highlight-card
```bash
sudo systemctl restart archwayd
```
::

Keep in mind that the process of replacing the genesis file is the same whether you are using Cosmovisor or not. Cosmovisor only helps automate the binary upgrade, while replacing the genesis file remains a manual process.
