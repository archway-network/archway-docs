# Running a local testnet

This guide explains how to run a local Archway testnet. If you have not installed an Archway node before, please follow this [guide here](../running-a-node/prerequisites).


## Create the required directories

To have a working test network we need at least two validator nodes.

First, let's create a directory to keep all nodes' data in an organized way:

::highlight-card

```bash
mkdir testnet
cd testnet
```

::

Since we will create two nodes in this testnet, let's:

Create a directory for the first node that will call **node1**.

::highlight-card
```bash
mkdir -p node1
```
::


Create a directory for the second node, that we will call **node2**:
::highlight-card

```bash
mkdir -p node2
```

::


## Initialize the first node


From the **testnet** folder, get inside the **node1** folder with:

::highlight-card
```bash
cd node1
```
::

Initiate **node1** with the chain name:

::highlight-card
```bash
archwayd init node1 --chain-id my-chain --home ./node1
```
::


You will see something similar after running the command:

::highlight-card
```bash
{"app_message":{"auth":{"accounts":[],"params":{"max_memo_characters":"256","sig_verify_cost_ed25519":"590","sig_verify_cost_secp256k1":"1000","tx_sig_limit":"7","tx_size_cost_per_byte":"10"}},"authz":{"authorization":[]},"bank":{"balances":[],"denom_metadata":[],"params":{"default_send_enabled":true,"send_enabled":[]},"supply":[]},"capability":{"index":"1","owners":[]},"crisis":{"constant_fee":{"amount":"1000","denom":"stake"}},"distribution":{"delegator_starting_infos":[],"....
```
::

Create a key to hold your account. An account consists of a pair of a public key and a private key. These keys are then stored in an object called a **keyring**.

::highlight-card
```bash
archwayd keys add node1-account --home ./node1
```
::

After running this command, you will be asked to create a **keyring** passphrase.

Once you have created a passphrase, you will see a similar message:

::highlight-card
```bash
  name: node1-account
  type: local
  address: archway10n7srpt0x859ghelguwxvxwh84vdsryy8ptel8
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"A6+usIOWVm2K45jsAzjhrRWDzDWANQsQvxXLtIZyT4OL"}'
  mnemonic: "
```
::

::alert{variant="info"}
Please safely store your mnemonic as it is required for recovering your account
#title

::

## Initialize the second node

Initialize the node with the same chain name that we used for the main node earlier.

From the **testnet** folder, go inside the **node2** folder using:

::highlight-card
```bash
cd node2
```
::

::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd init node2 --chain-id my-chain --home ./node2
```

::

Add keys to **node2**:

::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd keys add node2-account --home ./node2
```
::

Please take note of the address of **node2**, as you will need it.

## Set up the genesis file

Now, you should add the addresses of **node1** and **node2** to the Genesis file so that those nodes have enough tokens to start validating in the network.


1) From the **node1** folder open the genesis file:

::highlight-card

```bash
nano ./node1/config/genesis.json
```

::

2) Replace all the words **stake** with **validatortoken**, which is the name of the token for the local testnet. 

You can also use <a href="https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man1/sed.1.html#:~:text=Sed%20is%20a%20stream%20editor,and%20is%20consequently%20more%20efficient." target="_blank" >sed</a> to replace **stake** with **validatortoken**:

::highlight-card

```bash
sed -i -e "s|\S*stake\"|\"validatortoken\"|" ./node1/config/genesis.json
```

::

3) Go to the `"app_state":` section of the **config/genesis.json** file. In the `"accounts": []` section, add the data for the two accounts associated with **node1** and **node2**.

For example:

::highlight-card
```json
      "accounts": [
        {
          "@type": "/cosmos.auth.v1beta1.BaseAccount",
          "address": "archway17js24qztj05ve2gmgqzvgcsvufeq2me3kd2pnj",
          "pub_key": null,
          "account_number": "0",
          "sequence": "0"
        },

        {
          "@type": "/cosmos.auth.v1beta1.BaseAccount",
          "address": "archway195uq5lz84udvc8u5hxr4jsp0eg6x54a2jmq3zv",
          "pub_key": null,
          "account_number": "0",
          "sequence": "0"
        }
      ]
```
::

You can also use <a href="https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man1/sed.1.html#:~:text=Sed%20is%20a%20stream%20editor,and%20is%20consequently%20more%20efficient." target="_blank" >sed</a>  to replace **accounts** with:

::highlight-card

```bash
sed -i -e
"s|\"accounts\": *\[\]|\"accounts\": [{\"@type\":
\"/cosmos.auth.v1beta1.BaseAccount\",\"address\":
\"archway17js24qztj05ve2gmgqzvgcsvufeq2me3kd2pnj\", \"pub_key\":
null,\"account_number\": \"0\", \"sequence\": \"0\"},{\"@type\":
\"/cosmos.auth.v1beta1.BaseAccount\",\"address\":
\"archway195uq5lz84udvc8u5hxr4jsp0eg6x54a2jmq3zv\",\"pub_key\":
null,\"account_number\": \"0\",\"sequence\": \"0\"}]|" ./node1/config/genesis.json
```

::

4) Go to the `"bank":` section of the **config/genesis.json** file. In the `"balances": []`section, add the balances for **node1** and **node2**.

For example:

::highlight-card
```json

      "balances": [
        {
          "address": "archway17js24qztj05ve2gmgqzvgcsvufeq2me3kd2pnj",
          "coins": [
            {
              "denom": "validatortoken",
              "amount": "100000000000000"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "address": "archway195uq5lz84udvc8u5hxr4jsp0eg6x54a2jmq3zv",
          "coins": [
            {
              "denom": "validatortoken",
              "amount": "100000000000000"
            }
          ]
        }
      ],

```
::

You can also use <a href="https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man1/sed.1.html#:~:text=Sed%20is%20a%20stream%20editor,and%20is%20consequently%20more%20efficient." target="_blank" >sed</a>  to replace **balances** with:

::highlight-card

```bash
sed -i -e
"s|\"balances\":
*\[\]|\"balances\":[{\"address\":\"archway17js24qztj05ve2gmgqzvgcsvufeq2me3kd2pnj\",\"
coins\":[{\"denom\":\"validatortoken\",\"amount\":\"100000000000000\"}]},{\"address\":\"ar
chway195uq5lz84udvc8u5hxr4jsp0eg6x54a2jmq3zv\",\"coins\":[{\"denom\":\"validatortok
en\",\"amount\":\"100000000000000\"}]}]|" ./node1/config/genesis.json
```
::

**Alternative way:**

Another way to add the genesis accounts would be to add the validator key into the `genesis.app_state.accounts` array in the genesis file.

For the first node, you would launch the following command in the **node1** folder:


::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd add-genesis-account $(archwayd keys show node1-account -a --home ./node1) 1000000000validatortoken --home ./node1
```

::

For the second node, you would launch the following command in the **node2** folder:

::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd add-genesis-account $(archwayd keys show node1-account -a --home ./node2) 1000000000validatortoken --home ./node1
```

::

## Submit the genesis transaction

When running a Cosmos SDK-based blockchain, new validators need to submit a **gentx** transaction to the network to become a validator. The genesis transactions is the first transaction of the local chain, while the **collect-gentxs** command collects all the gentx transactions submitted by potential validators and creates a new genesis file that includes these transactions.

The command typically involves the following steps:

- Validators submit their **gentx** transactions to the network.
- The **collect-gentxs** command is run on each node in the network.
- The command collects all the **gentx** transactions that have been submitted.
- The command generates a new genesis file that includes all the collected **gentx** transactions.
- The new genesis file is distributed to all the nodes in the network.
- By using the **collect-gentxs** command, the network can ensure that all the validators are included in the genesis file and can start validating the network from the beginning of the blockchain.

Now you will generate the genesis transaction to create the validator. The gensesis transaction is the first transaction of the local chain:


::highlight-card
```bash
archwayd gentx node1-account 1000000000validatortoken --chain-id my-chain --home ./node1
archwayd collect-gentxs --home ./node1
```
::


## Fix port conflicts

As you are about to run the nodes on the same machine, you will need to resolve any port conflicts. Otherwise, errors such as **already in use ports** are returned.

To proceed, we can either:
- Run each node in isolated environments, such as Docker containers. (you can have a look at the Docker instruction in [the node installing section](../running-a-node/install#build-archwayd-with-docker)).
- Edit the **app.toml** and **conf.toml** files to setup different port numbers
- Use <a href="https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man1/sed.1.html#:~:text=Sed%20is%20a%20stream%20editor,and%20is%20consequently%20more%20efficient." target="_blank" >sed</a> for example with:

::highlight-card

```bash
sed -i.bak -e "s|^address *= \"0\.0\.0\.0:9090\"$|address = \"0\.0\.0\.0:9092\"|"
./node2/config/app.toml
```

::


### Changes to the **app.toml** file

In this section we look deeper into changing the **app.toml** and **conf.toml** files to fix port conflicts.
The first file we will change is the **app.toml** file. Go to this file by running the below commands:
::highlight-card

```bash
nano ./node2/config/app.toml

```

::

Under the **gRPC Configuration** `[grpc]` section you will see the **address** settings. Change the value to the below:

`enable = true
address=“0.0.0.0:9092”`

Under the **gRPC Web Configuration** `[grpc-web]` section you will see the **address** settings. Change the value to the below:
`address=“0.0.0.0:9093”`

Save the file after making the above changes.

### Changes to the **config.toml** file

The next file we will change is the **config.toml** file. Go to this file by running the below commands after you have made the first edits above:

::highlight-card

```bash
nano ./node2/config/config.toml
```

::

Under the **RPC Server Configuration Options** `[rpc]` you will see the **laddr** settings. Change the value to the below:
`laddr=“tcp://127.0.0.1:10002”`

Then find the **pprof_laddr** settings and change it to the value below:

`pprof_laddr=“localhost:6062”`

The last thing you need to change in this file is the listen port for p2p connections. This is under the **P2P Configuration Options** `[p2p]` and we will change the **laddr** value to the below:
`laddr=“tcp://0.0.0.0:20002”`


Save the file after making the above changes.


## Copy the genesis file

In order to join the local test network, we need to use the same genesis file of that network. The genesis file contains all the information and parameters about the initial state of our blockchain.

Copy the genesis file from the **node1** folder and replace **node2's** genesis file with it.

Make sure you are in the /testnet directory before running the below command.
::highlight-card

```bash
cp  node1/node1/config/genesis.json node2/node2/config/genesis.json

```

::


## Start the first validator node

In the **node1** folder, start the fist validator node:
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd start --home ./node1
```

::


Afer the node starts running, you should see a message like below:

::highlight-card

```bash
8:49PM INF starting node with ABCI Tendermint in-process
```

::

::alert{variant="info"}
In case you see the error message `listen tcp 0.0.0.0:9090: bind: address already in use`, open your `app.toml` and change the tcp address to another port(for example `9091`) by updating the `app.toml` with `address = "0.0.0.0:9091"` under both sections [grpc-web] and [grpc]

#title
Info
::


You have created the first node! Now let's create a second node to connect to our testnet.


## Find the seeds' addresses

To join a p2p network, you need the addresses of nodes to which you can connect to. You can find the address of **node1** by running the following command:

::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd status
```

::


::alert{variant="info"}
Please note that this command shows the status of the running node on default port. If we want to get the status of a specific node, we need to give it the IP address and the port it is listening to.
#title
Info
::

For example: `archwayd status -n tcp://localhost:10002` for **node2** that we just configured.

This command gives an output like the following:

::highlight-card

```json
{
  "NodeInfo": {
    "protocol_version": {
      "p2p": "8",
      "block": "11",
      "app": "0"
    },
    "id": "a118197af3c66781faa0299633cc59a1622d27e3",
    "listen_addr": "tcp://0.0.0.0:26656",
    "network": "chain-main",
    "version": "",
    "channels": "40202122233038606100",
    "moniker": "node1",
    "other": {
      "tx_index": "on",
      "rpc_address": "tcp://127.0.0.1:10003"
    }
  },
  "SyncInfo": {
    ...
  },
  "ValidatorInfo": {
    ...
  }
}
```

::

All we need is:

- The **id** which in our example is **a118197af3c66781faa0299633cc59a1622d27e3**
- The host name and its listening port **listen_addr** which here is: `tcp://0.0.0.0:26656`

## Start the second validator node

Since you are running the node on your local machine, the IP address is set to `0.0.0.0`, which refers to **localhost**. Therefore, you can use either **localhost** or `127.0.0.1`.

Now, in **node2** run the following command to let the second node join the network:

::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd --home ./node2 start --p2p.seeds a118197af3c66781faa0299633cc59a1622d27e3@localhost:26656
```

::

## Using gex to visualize the network status

<a href="https://github.com/cosmos/gex" target="_blank">Gex</a> is a real time in-terminal explorer for Cosmos SDK blockchains. Gex displays blocks, transactions, validator, network status, and more information. Use the GEX block explorer to see the status of peers, connection, version, and other useful information to have a quick peek into your own node.

Let's quickly install **Gex** to see the status of our node.

::highlight-card

```bash
go install github.com/cosmos/gex@latest
```

::

To launch GEX in your terminal window, type:

::highlight-card

```bash
gex
```

::


Before connecting to **node2**, our gex would have looked like this:

![](/images/docs/Gex01.png)

As you can see, the number of peers is zero. After starting the second now, gex should now look like this:

![](/images/docs/Gex02.png)

So now you have successfully joined a running network.

## Running a local testnet with docker

Docker allows you to have a single node local test net in an easy way.
First download the repository:

::highlight-card

```bash
git clone git@github.com:archway-network/archway.git
cd archway
```

::

Once the docker image is built successfully, run the following command:

::highlight-card

```bash
docker-compose up
```

::

If you want to hide the terminal output, just use flag `-d` like this:

::highlight-card

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

::
