# Running a Local Testnet

This guide explains how to run a local Archway testnet. If you have not installed a Archway node before, please follow this [guide here](../node/install.md).

To have a working test network we need at least one validator node. So, let's create a validator node.

## Initialize the first node

First, let's a directory to keep all nodes data in to stay organized:
::highlight-card

```bash
mkdir testnet
cd testnet
```

::
Since we will create two nodes in this testnet, let's create a directory for first node that will will call **node-main**.

```bash
mkdir -p node-main
```


Get inside the **node-main** folder with:
```bash
cd node-main
```

Initiate node-main with the chain name:


```bash
archwayd init node-main --chain-id my-chain --home ./node-main
```


You will see something similar after running the command:


```bash
{"app_message":{"auth":{"accounts":[],"params":{"max_memo_characters":"256","sig_verify_cost_ed25519":"590","sig_verify_cost_secp256k1":"1000","tx_sig_limit":"7","tx_size_cost_per_byte":"10"}},"authz":{"authorization":[]},"bank":{"balances":[],"denom_metadata":[],"params":{"default_send_enabled":true,"send_enabled":[]},"supply":[]},"capability":{"index":"1","owners":[]},"crisis":{"constant_fee":{"amount":"1000","denom":"stake"}},"distribution":{"delegator_starting_infos":[],"....
```


Create a key to hold your account. An account is a pair of public key and private key. These keys are then stored in an object called a **keyring**.


```bash
archwayd keys add node-main-account --home ./node-main
```


After running this command, you will be asked to create a **keyring** phrase. Create a **keyring** passphrase and re-enter the same phrase.

::alert{variant="info"}
Please remember and safely store your keyring passphrase as it is need to complete the following steps
#title
INFO
::

Once you have created a passphrase, you will see a similar message:


```bash
  name: node-main-account
  type: local
  address: archway10n7srpt0x859ghelguwxvxwh84vdsryy8ptel8
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"A6+usIOWVm2K45jsAzjhrRWDzDWANQsQvxXLtIZyT4OL"}'
  mnemonic: "
```

Now, you can either:

-  Add that key into the `genesis.app_state.accounts` array in the genesis file.


<!--This command lets you set the number of coins. Make sure this account has some coins
with the genesis.app_state.staking.params.bond_denom.
-->

- Or, alternatively, you can directly open the genesis file with:
`nano ./node-main/config/genesis.json`

Now, you should replace all the words **stake** with **validatortoken**, which is the name chosen for our local testnet.

<!--Note you will also see in bank section some pre-allocated tokens for **validatortoken**-->


When running a Cosmos SDK-based blockchain, new validators need to submit a **gentx** transaction to the network to become a validator. The gensesis transactions is the first transaction of the local chain, while the **collect-gentxs** command collects all the gentx transactions submitted by potential validators and creates a new genesis file that includes these transactions.

The command typically involves the following steps:

- Validators submit their **gentx** transactions to the network.
- The **collect-gentxs** command is run on each node in the network.
- The command collects all the **gentx** transactions that have been submitted.
- The command generates a new genesis file that includes all the collected **gentx** transactions.
- The new genesis file is distributed to all the nodes in the network.
- By using the **collect-gentxs** command, the network can ensure that all the validators are included in the genesis file and can start validating the network from the beginning of the blockchain.

Now we will generate the genesis transaction to create the validator, and collect it. The gensesis transactions is the first transaction of the local chain:


::highlight-card
```bash
archwayd gentx node-main-account 1000000000validatortoken --chain-id my-chain --home ./node-main
archwayd collect-gentxs --home ./node-main
```
::
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd add-genesis-account $(archwayd keys show node-main-account -a --home ./node-main) 1000000000stake,1000000000validatortoken --home ./node-main
```


::
<!--
Now we will generate the genesis transaction to create the validator. The gensesis transactions is the first transaction of the local chain.
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd gentx node-main-account 1000000000stake --chain-id my-chain --home ./node-main

archwayd collect-gentxs --home ./node-main
```

::
After running the above command, you will see a message like this:
::highlight-card

```bash
Genesis transaction written to "node-main/config/gentx/gentx-69b522ae3010219fc2317b3aa8f1c789df81fa30.json"
```
OUTADET CONTENT-->

Now let's start the validator node.
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd start --home ./node-main
```

::


Afer the node starts running, you should see a message like below:
::highlight-card

```bash
8:49PM INF starting node with ABCI Tendermint in-process
```

::

::alert{variant="info"}
In case you see the error message `listen tcp 0.0.0.0:9090: bind: address already in use`, open your `app.toml`and change the tcp address to another port(for example `9091`) by updating the `app.toml` with `address = "0.0.0.0:9091"` under both sections [grpc-web] and [grpc]

#title
INFO
::



You have created the first node! Now let's create a second node to connect to our testnet.

## Initialize the second node
For our local testnet, we would need at least a second node.
Open another terminal window and create a directory for the second node:
::highlight-card

```bash
mkdir -p node2
```

::
Initiate the node with the chain name like we did with the main node earlier.
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd init node2 --chain-id my-chain --home ./node2
```

::

## Fix port conflicts

Since we are running both nodes on the same machine, there will be some port conflicts,as errors like **already in use ports** are returned.

To proceed, we can either:
- Run each node in isolated environments, such as Docker containers. (you can have a look at the Docker instruction in [the node installing section](../node/install#build-archwayd-with-docker))
- Or edit the **app.toml** and **conf.toml** files to setup different port numbers:




### Changes to the **app.toml** file

The first file we will change is the **app.toml** file. Go to this file by running the below commands:
::highlight-card

```bash
nano ./node2/config/app.toml

```

::
Under the **gRPC Configuration** `[grpc]` section you will see the **address** settings. Change the value to the below:
<!-- 
| Original Value           | Changed Value            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| address = "0.0.0.0:9090" | address = "0.0.0.0:9092" |
-->

`enable = true
address=“0.0.0.0:9092”`

Under the **gRPC Web Configuration** `[grpc-web]` section you will see the **address** settings. Change the value to the below:
`address=“0.0.0.0:9093”`

Save the file after making the above changes.

### Changes to the **config.toml** file

The next file we will change is the **config.toml** file. Go to this file by running the below commands after you have made the first edits above:
::highlight-card

```bash
nano ./node2/config/config.toml
```

::
Under the **RPC Server Configuration Options** `[rpc]` you will see the **laddr** settings. Change the value to the below:
`laddr=“tcp://127.0.0.1:10002”`
<!-- 
| Original Value                  | Changed Value                   |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| laddr = "tcp://127.0.0.1:26657" | laddr = "tcp://127.0.0.1:10002" |
-->
Then find the **pprof_laddr** settings and change it to the value below:
<!-- 
| Original Value                 | Changed Value                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| pprof_laddr = "localhost:6060" | pprof_laddr = "localhost:6062" |
-->
`pprof_laddr=“localhost:6062”`
And the last thing we need to change in this file is the listen port for p2p connections. This is under the **P2P Configuration Options** `[p2p]` and we will change the **laddr** value to the below:
`laddr=“tcp://0.0.0.0:20002”`

<!-- 
| Original Value                | Changed Value                 |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| laddr = "tcp://0.0.0.0:26656" | laddr = "tcp://0.0.0.0:20002" |
-->
Save the edits to this file.


## Copy the genesis file

In order to join the local test network, we need to use the same genesis file of that network. The genesis file contains all the information and parameters about the initial state of our blockchain.

Let's copy it from the main node and replace it on our genesis file.

Make sure you are in the /testnet directory before running the below command
::highlight-card

```bash
cp ./node-main/config/genesis.json ./node2/config/
```

::

## Find addresses of the seeds

To join a p2p network we need the addresses of nodes that we are willing to connect to.
So let's find the address of the **main-node** via running the following command:
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd status
```

::


::alert{variant="info"}
Please note that this command shows the status of the running node on default port. If we want to get the status of a specific node, we need to give it the IP address and the port it is listening to. 
#title
INFO
::

For example: `archwayd status -n tcp://localhost:10002` for **node2** that we just configured.

This command gives an output like the following:
::highlight-card

```json
{
  "NodeInfo": {
    "protocol_version": {
      "p2p": "8",
      "block": "11",
      "app": "0"
    },
    "id": "a118197af3c66781faa0299633cc59a1622d27e3",
    "listen_addr": "tcp://0.0.0.0:26656",
    "network": "chain-main",
    "version": "",
    "channels": "40202122233038606100",
    "moniker": "node3",
    "other": {
      "tx_index": "on",
      "rpc_address": "tcp://127.0.0.1:10003"
    }
  },
  "SyncInfo": {
    ...
  },
  "ValidatorInfo": {
    ...
  }
}
```

::
All we need is

- The **id** which in our example is **a118197af3c66781faa0299633cc59a1622d27e3**
- The host name and its listening port **listen_addr** which here is: `tcp://0.0.0.0:26656`**`

## Join the network

Since we are running it on our local machine, the Ip address is `0.0.0.0` which refers to **localhost** we can use either **localhost** or `127.0.0.1`. 

Now let's run the following command to join the network:
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd --home ./node2 start --p2p.seeds a118197af3c66781faa0299633cc59a1622d27e3@localhost:26656
```

::

## Using Gex to visualize the network status

 <a href="https://github.com/cosmos/gex" target="_blank">Gex</a> is a real time in-terminal explorer for Cosmos SDK blockchains. Gex displays blocks, transactions, validator, network status, and more information. Use the GEX block explorer to see the status of peers, connection, version, and other useful information to have a quick peek into your own node.

Let's quickly install **Gex** to see the status of our node.
::highlight-card

```bash
go install github.com/cosmos/gex@latest
```

::
To launch a GEX in your terminal window, type:
::highlight-card

```bash
gex
```

::


Now, before connecting to the **main-node**, our gex looks like this:

![](../assets/Gex01.png)

As you can see the number of peers is zero. Now we run execute the join network command and it should look like this:

![](../assets/Gex02.png)

So now we successfully joined a running network.

## Running a Local Testnet with docker

Docker allows us to have a running a single node local test net in an easy way.
First download the repository:
::highlight-card

```bash
git clone git@github.com:archway-network/archway.git
cd archway
```

::
Once the docker image is built successfully, run the following command:
::highlight-card

```bash
docker-compose up
```

::
If you want to hide the terminal output, just use flag `-d` like this:
::highlight-card

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
