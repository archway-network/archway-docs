# Monitoring Validators

There is a [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) dashboard compatible with all the [cosmos-sdk](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) and [tendermint](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint) based blockchains.

## Preview

Let's set it up for our network.

## Prerequisites

First install [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) and [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) on your machine.

## Enable Tendermint Metrics

::highlight-card

```bash
sed -i 's/prometheus = false/prometheus = true/g' <YOUR-NODE-HOMEDIR>/config/config.toml
```

::
After restarting your node, you should be able to access the `tendermint` metrics(default port is 26660): <http://localhost:26660>

## Configure Prometheus Targets

Find `prometheus.yml` file and append the following `job` under the `scrape_configs`:

```yaml
- job_name: archway
  static_configs:
    - targets: ['localhost:26660']
      labels:
        instance: validator
```

**Note:** On linux machines this file can be found under this path: `/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml`

## Resolving Port Conflicts

If you run your `archway` network and `Prometheus` on the same machine, you will see one of them cannot run due to a port conflict. Let's resolve it.

**Open the `./node-main/config/app.toml` file and look for**

```toml
[grpc]
address = "0.0.0.0:9090"
```

Then change the port to something else like this:

```toml
[grpc]
address = "0.0.0.0:9095"
```

## Restart Prometheus

::highlight-card

```bash
sudo service prometheus restart
```

::
Check the status if the prometheus service is running properly:
::highlight-card

```bash
systemctl status prometheus.service
```

::

If you see some output like this, it means it is running without an issue:

```

     CGroup: /system.slice/prometheus.service
             └─457917 /usr/bin/prometheus
```

## Configure Grafana

if you have grafana installed on your machine, you can access it via navigating to this address: <http://localhost:3000>

The default username and password is `admin`.

Click on config, then add a data source.

Then select Prometheus from the list and add its URL.

If you have installed it on your machine, the default URL is: <http://localhost:9090>

Click on `Save & test` to make sure everything is alright.

## Import Grafana Dashboard

Copy and paste the [Grafana Dashboard ID](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/11036) `11036` and click on `Load` to complete importing.

Now you should be able to monitor your validator node.
