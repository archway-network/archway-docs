# Join a Network

Now you would need your node to join one of the available networks running on Archway.


<!--
## Cleaning up

If you already tried setting up a node or running a local testnet, it may be good to remove any  previous genesis file and configuration that you have used, let's first cleanup our network.

::highlight-card

```bash
rm -rf ~/.archway
```

::

::alert{variant="warning"}
This command will remove all data and configs you already set.

<!--## Initialize the node

Now run the following command to initialize the genesis file which is required to establish a network. In this guide, we will also show example of connecting to the [Constantine Developer Testnet](https://docs.archway.io/docs/overview/network#constantine-dapp-developer-testnet).

::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}

```

<!--### **Constantine Example**

Using Docker, here is how to initialize the node for the Constantine Testnet:
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run -v ${HOME}/.archway:/root/.archway docker.io/archwaynetwork/archwayd:0.0.5  init munshi --chain-id constantine-2
```

::
ADDED TO THE 1.INSTALL SECTION-->
## Retrieve the Genesis file

First, you will need to use the [Networks page](../../resources/networks) to find information like the `<chain-id>` and `<rpc-url>` of the network you would like to connect to.

With the above data, make sure to download correct Genesis file, by fetching it from an available node:

::highlight-card

```bash
curl -s "$RPC_ENDPOINT/genesis" | jq '.result.genesis' > ~/.archway/config/genesis.json
```

::
### **Constantine Genesis file**
For example, you can launch the command to connect to the RPC Endpoint of the Constantine network, and download the Genesis File:
::highlight-card

```bash
curl -s https://rpc.constantine-2.archway.tech/genesis |jq -r .result.genesis > ${HOME}/.archway/config/genesis.json
```

## Start archwayd


Start the archway and join the network:

::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
Binary

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd start \
  --x-crisis-skip-assert-invariants
  --p2p.seeds Address1@Host_Name_OR_IP1:PORT1, ...AddressN@Host_Name_OR_IPN:PORTN \
```
::

#title1
Docker

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway archwaynetwork/archwayd:$NETWORK_NAME \
  start \
  --x-crisis-skip-assert-invariants
  --p2p.seeds Address1@Host_Name_OR_IP1:PORT1, ...AddressN@Host_Name_OR_IPN:PORTN \
```

::

::

Below is the command to join the **Constantine testnet**:

::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
Binary

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd start \
  --x-crisis-skip-assert-invariants
  --p2p.seeds e5e4a459b85e7bd3f1769e08b7f488b9d0648844@104.154.204.236:26656 --unsafe-skip-upgrades 187340
```
::

#title1
Docker

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run -v ${HOME}/.archway:/root/.archway -p 9091:9091 -p 9090:9090 -p 26656:26656 -p 26657:26657 -p 1317:1317 docker.io/archwaynetwork/archwayd:constantine \
  start \
  --p2p.seeds e5e4a459b85e7bd3f1769e08b7f488b9d0648844@104.154.204.236:26656 --unsafe-skip-upgrades 187340
```

::

::


Please note that currently the flag **--unsafe-skip-upgrades 187340** is needed to correctly sync your node. Alternatively, you can directly sync from that specific block, for example by adding the flag: **--halt-height 187341** instead.

## Cleaning up (optional)

In case you want to remove any previous previous genesis file and configuration that you have used, you can clean up the network.

::highlight-card

```bash
rm -rf ~/.archway
```

::

::alert{variant="warning"}
This command will remove all data and configs you already set.

## Next Steps
Now that you have joined a network, you can either [start validating](../becoming-a-validator/overview), or further [configure](/configure) the validator (optional).
