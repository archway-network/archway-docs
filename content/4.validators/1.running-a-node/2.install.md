# Node Installation

This guide explains how to install and run an Archway full node.


## Build archwayd from Source


### **Clone the repository**
Now let's get the source code from the <a href="https://github.com/archway-network/archway" target="_blank">Archway Repository</a>.
::highlight-card

```bash

git clone https://github.com/archway-network/archway.git

cd archway

git fetch

git checkout <version-tag>

```

::

::alert{variant="info"}
For connecting to the Constantine Developer Testnet, the version tag `v0.2.0` should be used:

`git checkout v0.2.0`

#title
INFO
::

### **Build archwayd**
Let's build and install the `archwayd` daemon:
::highlight-card

```bash
make install
```

::
Confirm that the installation has been completed by running the following command:
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd version

#1.2.3
```

::

## Build archwayd with Docker

Make sure you have <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker" target="_blank" title="Install Docker">Docker</a> installed on your machine. 


::alert{variant="warning"}
For Linux users, it's recommended to run the Docker daemon in <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/" target="_blank" title="Docker Rootless mode">Rootless Mode</a>.
#title
WARNING

### **Pull the Docker image**

Pull the image from <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/archwaynetwork/archwayd" target="_blank">Docker Hub</a>
:

Each Archway network uses a different version of Archway. To connect your node to a network, you should use a tag with the corresponding network name.



 For example, to connect to the Constantine testnet:
::highlight-card

```bash
docker pull archwaynetwork/archwayd:constantine
```

::
::alert{variant="info"}
Make sure to always use the image tag that points to the network you want to connect.
#title
INFO
::


Please note that the latest Docker image corresponds to the Titus experimental testnet. Titus is not completely stable, and it is suggested not relying on it.

::highlight-card

```bash
docker pull archwaynetwork/archwayd:latest
```

::

### **Set up the PATH**


By default, the Docker image runs the `archwayd` binary, so you should specify the arguments for `archwayd` right after the image name. For better usage, mount an external volume at `/root/.archway` to persist the daemon home path across different runs. For example, if you want to add a key:
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway \
  archwaynetwork/archwayd:latest \
  keys add test-key
```

::
And then list all keys:
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway \
  archwaynetwork/archwayd:latest \
  keys list
```

::
It's also important to notice that, when running a node in a network, you'll need to expose the container ports for external connectivity. The image exposes the following ports:

- `1317`: Rest server
- `26656`: Tendermint P2P
- `26657`: Tendermint RPC

::alert{variant="success"}
To simplify using the Docker container, you can set an alias with the home path and the proper image tag (replacing `<network-name>`), like:
::highlight-card

```bash
alias archwayd="docker run --rm -it -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway archwaynetwork/archwayd:<network-name>"
```

::

#title
TIP
::

After setting the alias with the above tip, you can use the other `archwayd` commands without typing the verbose Docker run command.
For the sake of comprehensive documentation, the full Docker command is shown. Just remember that by setting the alias you can simply use `archwayd` instead of the Docker command :)













## Initialize the Node


Initialize the **genesis.json** file that is required to establish a network.
You will also need to choose a **moniker** for your node, which is the name that will appear on the blockexplorer once you will start validating.
::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
Binary

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd init <moniker> --chain-id <chain>
```

::

#title1
Docker

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway archwaynetwork/archwayd:$NETWORK_NAME \
  init <moniker> --chain-id <chain>
```

::

::

For example, for the Constaine network:

::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
Binary

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd init my-cool-moniker --chain-id constantine
```

::

#title1
Docker

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run -v ${HOME}/.archway:/root/.archway docker.io/archwaynetwork/archwayd:constantine  init my-cool-moniker --chain-id constantine-2
```

::

::


<!-- ## Starting the Node

Starting a node now will give you an error message like the one below. This is because at least one validator node must be connected for the network to run.
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd start

Error: error during handshake: error on replay: validator set is nil in genesis and still empty after InitChain
```

::

Now it is time to set up your [node's keys](keys.md)
