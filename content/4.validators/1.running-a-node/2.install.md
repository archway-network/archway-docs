# Node installation

This guide provides instructions on how to install and run a full node on the Archway blockchain network.

## Use the pre-built binary

### Download the binary
You can download the latest release of the pre-built binary from the <a href='https://github.com/archway-network/archway/releases' target='_blank'>releases page</a>.


For Linux, and depending on your architecture:


::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
amd64

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
wget https://github.com/archway-network/archway/releases/download/v1.0.1/archwayd_linux_amd64
```

::

#title1
arm64

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
wget https://github.com/archway-network/archway/releases/download/v1.0.1/archwayd_linux_arm64

```

::

::

### Verify the integrity of the binary

You can now verify the download by generating the sha256 hash for the downloaded file:







::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
amd64

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
sha256sum archwayd_linux_amd64
```

::

#title1
arm64

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
sha256sum archwayd_linux_arm64

```

::

::



Using the *sha256sum* should give you a string (i.e.
*4dd95ee0729b6593c9c390bde6e0c7bf3af0957d7f323e216b76ddb663fa7bc7*).

You can then download the sha256 checksum file relative to the release file:

::highlight-card
```bash
wget archwaysha256.txt https://github.com/archway-network/archway/releases/download/v1.0.1/archwayd_v1.0.1_checksums.txt

```
::

and you can compare that the sha256 hash strings match, By doing so, you are ensuring that the downloaded file matches the actual release file.

### Add executable permissions

After downloading the file, you can add executable permissions to it using the chmod command:

::highlight-card
```bash
chmod +x archwayd_linux_amd64
```
::


The above command makes the binary executable.

### Move the binary to the chosen directory
You can now move the binary to a directory in your PATH. The **/usr/local/bin directory** is commonly used for custom user programs not managed by the distribution package manager and is usually included in the **PATH**. You can move your file there with the **mv** command and also rename it to **archwayd** at the same time:

::highlight-card
```bash
sudo mv archwayd_linux_amd64 /usr/local/bin/archwayd
```
::

## Use the archwayd docker image

As an alternative, you can also use <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker" target="_blank" title="Install Docker">Docker</a> (make sure to install it).


::alert{variant="warning"}
For Linux users, it's recommended to run the Docker daemon in <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/" target="_blank" title="Docker Rootless mode">Rootless Mode</a>.
#title
Warning

### Pull the docker image


You can pull the docker image from the following repositories:

- <a href="https://github.com/archway-network/archway/pkgs/container/archwayd" target="_blank">Production</a>

- <a href="https://github.com/archway-network/archway/pkgs/container/archwayd-debug" target="_blank">Development and Debugging</a>

Make sure to pull the docker image relative to the latest <a href="https://github.com/archway-network/archway/releases" target="_blank">release</a>.


For example, to connect to the Tromphe mainnet or Constantine testnet, issue the following command:

::highlight-card

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/archway-network/archwayd:v1.0.1
```

::
::alert{variant="info"}
Make sure to always use the image tag that points to the network you want to connect.

### Set up the PATH


By default, the Docker image runs the `archwayd` binary, so you should specify the arguments for `archwayd` right after the image name. For better usage, mount an external volume at `/root/.archway` to persist the daemon home path across different runs. For example, if you want to add a key:

::highlight-card

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway \
  ghcr.io/archway-network/archwayd:v1.0.1 \
  keys add test-key
```

::

And then list all keys:

::highlight-card

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway \
  ghcr.io/archway-network/archwayd:v1.0.1 \
  keys list
```

::

It's also important to notice that, when running a node in a network, you'll need to expose the container ports for external connectivity. The image exposes the following ports:

- **1317**: Rest server
- **26656**: Tendermint P2P
- **26657**: Tendermint RPC

::alert{variant="info"}
To simplify using the Docker container, you can set an alias with the home path and the proper image tag, like:

::highlight-card

```bash
alias archwayd="docker run --rm -it -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway ghcr.io/archway-network/archwayd:v1.0.1"
```

::

#title
Info
::

After setting the alias with the above tip, you can use the other **archwayd** commands without typing the verbose Docker run command.
For the sake of comprehensive documentation, the full Docker command is shown. Just remember that by setting the alias you can simply use **archwayd** instead of the Docker command.



## Build archwayd from source (not recommended)

If you cannot use the pre-built binary or the docker image, you can build the binary yourself.

### Clone the repository
Alternatively, you can clone the source code from the <a href='https://github.com/archway-network/archway' target='_blank'>Archway repository</a>. Go to <a href='https://github.com/archway-network/archway/releases' target='_blank'>https://github.com/archway-network/archway/releases</a> to find the latest releases. You will then switch the **\<version-tag\>** below with the latest release version.

::highlight-card

```bash

git clone https://github.com/archway-network/archway.git

cd archway

git fetch

git checkout v1.0.1

```

::

### Set the GOPATH

Make sure to correctly set up the **GOPATH**, by either adding it to the **~/.bashrc** file or launching the following commands from the shell:

::highlight-card

```bash
export GOPATH=$HOME/go 
export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin:$GOPATH/bin
```

::
And then update your terminal shell by launching:
::highlight-card

```bash
source ~/.profile
```

::

### Build archwayd
Do the following to build and install the **archwayd** daemon:

::highlight-card

```bash
make install
```

::

Confirm that the installation has been completed by running the following command:

::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd version
```

::


::alert{variant="info"}
It is not recommended to build binary yourself, unless no other option is available.

## Ensure that archwayd is installed

You can now verify that **archwayd** has been correctly installed by launching:


::highlight-card
```bash

```
::
