# Node installation

This guide provides instructions on how to install and run a full node on the Archway blockchain network.

## Downlaod the pre-built binary

You can download the latest release of the <a href='https://github.com/archway-network/archway/releases' target='_blank'>pre-built binary</a>, as this is the recommended way.


## Build archwayd from source


### Clone the repository
Alternatively, you can clone the source code from the <a href='https://github.com/archway-network/archway' target='_blank'>Archway repository</a>. Go to <a href='https://github.com/archway-network/archway/releases' target='_blank'>https://github.com/archway-network/archway/releases</a> to find the latest releases. You will then switch the **\<version-tag\>** below with the latest release version.

::highlight-card

```bash

git clone https://github.com/archway-network/archway.git

cd archway

git fetch

git checkout <version-tag>

```

::

### Build archwayd
Do the following to build and install the **archwayd** daemon:

::highlight-card

```bash
make install
```

::

Confirm that the installation has been completed by running the following command:

::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd version
```

::



## Build archwayd with docker

As an alternative, you can also use <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker" target="_blank" title="Install Docker">Docker</a> (make sure to install it).


::alert{variant="warning"}
For Linux users, it's recommended to run the Docker daemon in <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/" target="_blank" title="Docker Rootless mode">Rootless Mode</a>.

### Pull the docker image

You will need to pull the docker image from <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/archwaynetwork/archwayd" target="_blank">Docker Hub</a>. Each Archway network uses a different version of Archway and therefore to connect your node to a network, you should use a tag with the corresponding network name.

For example, to connect to the **Constantine** testnet, issue the following command:

::highlight-card

```bash
docker pull archwaynetwork/archwayd:constantine
```

::
::alert{variant="info"}
Make sure to always use the image tag that points to the network you want to connect.
#title
Info
::


Please note that the **latest** Docker image corresponds to the **Titus** experimental testnet, which is not completely stable. Therefore, it is suggested that you do not rely on it.

::highlight-card

```bash
docker pull archwaynetwork/archwayd:latest
```

::

### Set up the PATH


By default, the Docker image runs the `archwayd` binary, so you should specify the arguments for `archwayd` right after the image name. For better usage, mount an external volume at `/root/.archway` to persist the daemon home path across different runs. For example, if you want to add a key:

::highlight-card

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway \
  archwaynetwork/archwayd:constantine \
  keys add test-key
```

::

And then list all keys:

::highlight-card

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway \
  archwaynetwork/archwayd:constantine \
  keys list
```

::

It's also important to notice that, when running a node in a network, you'll need to expose the container ports for external connectivity. The image exposes the following ports:

- **1317**: Rest server
- **26656**: Tendermint P2P
- **26657**: Tendermint RPC

::alert{variant="info"}
To simplify using the Docker container, you can set an alias with the home path and the proper image tag (replacing `<network-name>` with the correct tag), like:

::highlight-card

```bash
alias archwayd="docker run --rm -it -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway archwaynetwork/archwayd:<network-name>"
```

::

#title
Info
::

After setting the alias with the above tip, you can use the other **archwayd** commands without typing the verbose Docker run command.
For the sake of comprehensive documentation, the full Docker command is shown. Just remember that by setting the alias you can simply use **archwayd** instead of the Docker command.


## Initialize the node


Initialize the **genesis.json** file, which is required to establish a connection to an Archway network. You will also need to choose a **moniker** for your node, which is the name that will appear on the block explorer once you start validating.

::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
Binary

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd init <moniker> --chain-id <chain>
```

::

#title1
Docker

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway archwaynetwork/archwayd:<NETWORK_NAME> init <moniker> --chain-id <chain>
```

::

::

To connect to a specific network, you would need to change the **\<chain\>** accordingly.

For example, for the **Triomphe** mainnet network you would launch:

::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
Binary

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd init my-node --chain-id archway-1
```

::

#title1
Docker

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run -v ${HOME}/.archway:/root/.archway docker.io/archwaynetwork/archwayd:constantine  init my-cool-moniker --chain-id archway-1
```

::

::







While for the **Constantine** testnet network you would launch:

::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
Binary

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd init my-node --chain-id constantine-3
```

::

#title1
Docker

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run -v ${HOME}/.archway:/root/.archway docker.io/archwaynetwork/archwayd:constantine  init my-cool-moniker --chain-id constantine-3
```

::

## Next steps

Now it is time to set up your [node's keys](keys.md).
