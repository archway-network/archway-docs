# Sync from genesis

This is the slowest (and most secure) way to sync your node, as your node goes through every block since the genesis block.


You can use the [Networks page](../../resources/networks) to find useful information such as the **chain-id** and  **rpc-url** of the network you would like to connect to.

With the above data, make sure to download correct genesis file, by fetching it from an available node:

::highlight-card

```bash
curl -s "$RPC_ENDPOINT/genesis" | jq '.result.genesis' > ~/.archway/config/genesis.json
```

::
## Constantine Genesis file

You can find relevant information regarding **constatine-2** on <a href="ttps://github.com/archway-network/networks/tree/main/constantine-" target="_blank">Github</a>.
For example, you can launch the command to connect to the RPC Endpoint of the Constantine network, and download the Genesis File:
::highlight-card

```bash
curl -s https://rpc.constantine-2.archway.tech/genesis |jq -r .result.genesis > ${HOME}/.archway/config/genesis.json
```

::


You can also download the genesis file from github, for example by launching:
::highlight-card

```bash
wget https://github.com/archway-network/networks/raw/main/constantine-2/genesis.json.tar.gz
```

::


<!--
## Cleaning up

If you already tried setting up a node or running a local testnet, it may be good to remove any  previous genesis file and configuration that you have used, let's first cleanup our network.

::highlight-card

```bash
rm -rf ~/.archway
```

::

::alert{variant="warning"}
This command will remove all data and configs you already set.

<!--## Initialize the node

Now run the following command to initialize the genesis file which is required to establish a network. In this guide, we will also show example of connecting to the [Constantine Developer Testnet](https://docs.archway.io/docs/overview/network#constantine-dapp-developer-testnet).

## Start the node

### Start archwayd (default)


Start the archway and join the network:

::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
Binary

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd start \
  --x-crisis-skip-assert-invariants
  --p2p.seeds Address1@Host_Name_OR_IP1:PORT1, ...AddressN@Host_Name_OR_IPN:PORTN \
```
::

#title1
Docker

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway archwaynetwork/archwayd:$NETWORK_NAME \
  start \
  --x-crisis-skip-assert-invariants
  --p2p.seeds Address1@Host_Name_OR_IP1:PORT1, ...AddressN@Host_Name_OR_IPN:PORTN \
```

::

::

Below is the command to join the **Constantine testnet**:

::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
Binary

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd start \
  --x-crisis-skip-assert-invariants
  --p2p.seeds e5e4a459b85e7bd3f1769e08b7f488b9d0648844@104.154.204.236:26656
```
::

<!-- --unsafe-skip-upgrades 187340 -->


#title1

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run -v ${HOME}/.archway:/root/.archway -p 9091:9091 -p 9090:9090 -p 26656:26656 -p 26657:26657 -p 1317:1317 docker.io/archwaynetwork/archwayd:constantine \
  start \
  --p2p.seeds e5e4a459b85e7bd3f1769e08b7f488b9d0648844@104.154.204.236:26656 
```
<!-- --unsafe-skip-upgrades 187340 -->
::

::


<!--Please note that currently the flag **--unsafe-skip-upgrades 187340** is needed to correctly sync your node. Alternatively, you can directly sync from that specific block, for example by adding the flag: **--halt-height 187341** instead.
-->


### Start archwayd as a service

A service file can be used to allow the automatic restart of the service, and it helps to enhance the reliability of your node.

You can create a service file with:

::highlight-card

```bash
nano /etc/systemd/system/archwayd.service

```

::




And add the following content to the file:

::highlight-card

```service
[Unit]
Description=Archway Node
After=network-online.target
[Service]
User=$USER
ExecStart=/home/$USER/go/bin/archwayd start
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=4096
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```

::

You can then reload the systemctl daemon:
::highlight-card

```bash

sudo -S systemctl daemon-reload
```

::

Enable the  service:

::highlight-card

```bash

sudo -S systemctl enable archwayd
```

::

And then start **archwayd** as a service:

::highlight-card

```bash

sudo systemctl start archwayd
```

::


You can then check that the service is properly running with:
::highlight-card

```bash

sudo systemctl status archwayd
```

::



### Start archwayd docker as a service

A service file can be used to allow the automatic restart of the service, and it helps to enhance the reliability of your node.

You can create a service file with:

::highlight-card

```bash
nano /etc/systemd/system/archwayd.service

```

::




And add the following content to the file:

::highlight-card

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Archway Node
After=network-online.target
[Service]
User=$USER
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run --rm -it -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway
archwaynetwork/archwayd:latest
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=4096
[Install]WantedBy=multi-user.target

```

::


You can then reload the systemctl daemon:
::highlight-card

```bash

sudo -S systemctl daemon-reload
```

::



Enable the  service:

::highlight-card

```bash

sudo -S systemctl enable archwayd
```

::

And then start **archwayd** as a service:

::highlight-card

```bash

sudo systemctl start archwayd
```

::


You can then check that the service is properly running with:
::highlight-card

```bash

sudo systemctl status archwayd
```

::




## Cleaning up (optional)

In case you want to remove any previous genesis file and configuration that you have used, you can clean up the network.

::highlight-card

```bash
rm -rf ~/.archway
```

::

::alert{variant="warning"}
This command will remove all data and configs you already set.

## Next Steps
Now that you have joined a network, you can either [start validating](../becoming-a-validator/overview), or further [configure](/validators/running-a-node/configure) the validator (optional).
