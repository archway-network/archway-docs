# Sync with state-sync
**state-sync** is a feature that allows nodes to quickly sync their state by fetching a snapshot of the application state at a specific block height.
This greatly reduces the time required for node to sync with the network, compared to the default method of replaying all blocks from the genesis block. There are two ways for syncing your node with state-sync:
1) Through a snapshot-enabled RPC and from a trusted block height.
2) Through the validated archival snapshots by KYVE.

An advantage of state-sync is that the database is very small in comparison to a fully synced node, therefore using state-sync to resync your node to the network can help keep running costs lower by minimizing storage usage.


::alert{variant="info"}
When syncing a node through a **snapshot-enabled RPC**, you won't have the full transaction history of the network, but only the most recent state that the state-sync RPC has stored. With the **validated snapshots by KYVE**, it is possible to sync to any height.

## 1. How to sync through RPC

First,make sure to have installed the necessary [dependencies](prerequisites), installed [archwayd](install) and set up your [keys](keys).

::alert{variant="info"}
Before going any further, it is recommended to set up [Cosmovisor](/validators/running-a-node/cosmovisor).
#title
Info
::

Then:

1) in the **.archwayd/config** folder, open the **config.toml** file with:

::highlight-card

```bash
nano ~/.archwayd/config/config.toml
```

::
and go to in the **[statesync]** section.

2) Set enable to true to enable state sync:

::highlight-card

```toml
enable = true
```

::


3) Set **rpc_servers** to a list of trusted nodes with state sync enabled:

::highlight-card

```toml
rpc_servers = "<trusted_node_1>,<trusted_node_2>,<trusted_node_3>"
```

::

For example:





::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
mainnet

#desc0
::highlight-card

```toml
rpc_servers = "https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443"
```

::

#title1
testnet

#desc1
::highlight-card

```toml
rpc_servers = "https://rpc.constantine.archway.tech:443"
```
::

::




Alternatively, if you prefer using snap, you could also set a local variable in your terminal shell, by typing:


::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
mainnet

#desc0
::highlight-card

```
SNAP_RPC= https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443
```

::

#title1
testnet

#desc1
::highlight-card

```
SNAP_RPC= https://rpc.constantine.archway.tech:443
```


::

::





and making sure that the local variable is correctly set:
::highlight-card

```
echo $SNAP_RPC
```

::


4) Set trust_height and trust_hash to the block height and hash of a trusted block, and replace **<trusted_block_height>** and **<trusted_block_hash>** with the actual values:

::highlight-card

```toml
trust_height = <trusted_block_height>
trust_hash = "<trusted_block_hash>"
```

::

For example:
::highlight-card

```toml
trust_height = 1354507
trust_hash = 0101585D26CB0CCB1FBDADA8A91DB88A9FE4D15D517804EEFA337613F07F3F36
```

::


In order to fetch the correct values, we can use local variable and use curl.

In your terminal shell, get the latest block height by launching:
::highlight-card

```bash
LATEST_HEIGHT=$(curl -s $SNAP_RPC/block | jq -r .result.block.header.height)

```

::
Then you can get the trusted block height, which is a previous block:
::highlight-card

```bash
BLOCK_HEIGHT=$((LATEST_HEIGHT - 100))

```

::
And then get the hash of the trusted block by launching:
::highlight-card

```bash
TRUST_HASH=$(curl -s "$SNAP_RPC/block?height=$BLOCK_HEIGHT" | jq -r .result.block_id.hash)

```

::
Now, make sure that those variables are properly set:

::highlight-card

```bash
echo $LATEST_HEIGHT $BLOCK_HEIGHT $TRUST_HASH

```
::
The console should output some values, such as:

*1355507 1354507 0101585D26CB0CCB1FBDADA8A91DB88A9FE4D15D517804EEFA337613F07F3F36*

You can update the **config.toml** with those values:


::highlight-card

```bash
sed -i.bak -E "s|^(enable[[:space:]]+=[[:space:]]+).*$|\1true| ; \
s|^(rpc_servers[[:space:]]+=[[:space:]]+).*$|\1\"$SNAP_RPC,$SNAP_RPC\"| ; \
s|^(trust_height[[:space:]]+=[[:space:]]+).*$|\1$BLOCK_HEIGHT| ; \
s|^(trust_hash[[:space:]]+=[[:space:]]+).*$|\1\"$TRUST_HASH\"| ; \
s|^(seeds[[:space:]]+=[[:space:]]+).*$|\1\"\"|" $HOME/.archway/config/config.toml

```

## 2. How to sync through KYVE

KYVE is a blockchain that validates and archives chain data like Archway blocks and state-sync snapshots.
The tool KSYNC provides the possibility to use the validated data in order to sync an Archway node
to any height.

::alert{variant="info"}
More information about KYVE and KSYNC can be found in the [KYVE Docs](https://docs.kyve.network).
#title
Info

### Prerequisites

First, make sure to have installed the correct `archwayd` version of the target height.

Initialize the node with:
```bash
archwayd init <moniker> --chain-id archway-1
```

Download the correct genesis file:
```bash
wget -qO- https://github.com/archway-network/networks/raw/main/archway/genesis/genesis.json.gz | zcat > ~/.archway/config/genesis.json
```

### KSYNC Installation

#### Install with Go (recommended)

Install the latest version:

```bash
go install github.com/KYVENetwork/ksync/cmd/ksync@latest
```

Run `ksync version` to verify the installation.

#### Install from source

You can also install from source by pulling the ksync repository and switching to the correct version and building
as follows:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:KYVENetwork/ksync.git
cd ksync
git checkout tags/vx.x.x -b vx.x.x
make ksync
```

This will build ksync in `/build` directory. Afterwards, you may want to put it into your machine's PATH like
as follows:

```bash
cp build/ksync ~/go/bin/ksync
```

### KSYNC usage
After the correct setup, KSYNC will manage the state-sync process completely. There are 2 different ways of state-syncing your node with KSYNC:

#### 1. State-Sync
You can _state-sync_ a node to the **latest available snapshot** archived by KYVE with the following command:
```bash
ksync state-sync --binary="/path/to/archwayd" --home="/path/to/.archway" --snapshot-pool-id=4
```

You can also _state-sync_ a node to a **specific snapshot** with `--target-height` (KSYNC will use the nearest available snapshot):
```bash
ksync state-sync --binary="/path/to/archwayd" --home="/path/to/.archway" --snapshot-pool-id=4 --target-height=<height>
```

#### 2. Height-Sync
Because KYVE not only validates and archives state snapshots but also blocks, it is possible to sync to any height. Therefore, the nearest state snapshot will be used in order to sync to the target height with the validated blocks. Simply run:
```bash
ksync height-sync --binary="/path/to/archwayd" --home="/path/to/.archway" --snapshot-pool-id=4 --block-pool-id=2 --target-height=<height>
```

::alert{variant="info"}
To get information about the latest available block and snapshot height, run `ksync info`.

## Start the node

### Starting archwayd (default)


Before going any further, it is recommended to set up [Cosmovisor](/validators/running-a-node/cosmovisor).


Now you can start the node:


Mainnet
::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
Binary

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd start \
  --p2p.seeds 3ba7bf08f00e228026177e9cdc027f6ef6eb2b39@35.232.234.58:26656

### Start archwayd as a service
Remember that you can start the node as a service by creating a service file:
::highlight-card

```bash
sudo /etc/systemd/system/archwayd.service

```

::
::highlight-card

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Archway Node
After=network.target

[Service]
User=$USER
Type=simple
ExecStart=$(which archwayd) start
Restart=on-failure
LimitNOFILE=65535

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```

::
Start the service by:
Reloading the daemon:
::highlight-card

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

```

::
Enable **archwayd**:
::highlight-card

```bash
sudo systemctl enable archwayd
```

::
Start **archwayd** as a service:
::highlight-card

```bash
sudo systemctl restart archwayd
```

::
Keep track of the logs:
::highlight-card

```bash
sudo journalctl -u archwayd -f -o cat
```

::


### Start the archwayd docker as a service

A service file can be used to allow the automatic restart of the service, and it helps to enhance the reliability of your node.

You can create a service file with:

::highlight-card

```bash
nano /etc/systemd/system/archwayd.service

```

::




And add the following content to the file:

::highlight-card

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Archway Node
After=network-online.target
[Service]
User=$USER
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run --rm -it -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway
ghcr.io/archway-network/archwayd:$$archwayVersion$$
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=4096
[Install]WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

::

You can then reload the systemctl daemon:
::highlight-card

```bash

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

::

Enable the  service:

::highlight-card

```bash

sudo -S systemctl enable archwayd
```

::

And then start **archwayd** as a service:

::highlight-card

```bash

sudo systemctl start archwayd
```

::


You can then check that the service is properly running with:
::highlight-card

```bash

sudo systemctl status archwayd
```

::
