# Sync from snapshot
A snapshot is a compressed archive of the state of a blockchain node at a specific block height. Syncing a node with a snapshot speeds up the process of catching up with the network, as the node starts from the snapshot's block height instead of from the genesis block.


In order to sync your node through a snapshot, you will need to:
- Download the pre-built binary
- Download the snapshot (from a trusted source).
- Download the genesis file
- Configure your node
- Start archwayd

## Download the pre-built binary
Make sure to [follow the instructions](/validators/running-a-node/install) to download the pre-built archwayd binary. 

Once downloaded, grant the permissions to the binary, for example with:


::highlight-card

```bash
chmod +x archwayd_linux_amd64
```

::
You can also create a symbolic link named **archwayd** that points to **archwayd_linux_amd64** using the **ln** command:
::highlight-card

```bash
ln -s ./archwayd_linux_amd64 archwayd
```

::
## Download the snapshot
You can download the latest snapshot from:

<a href="https://snapshots.archway.io" target="_blank">snapshots.archway.io</a>.

Also, you can use the snapshot maintained by the community. Please make sure to be aware of the possible risks of using unofficial snapshots solutions.

- <a href="https://services.kjnodes.com/home/testnet/archway/snapshot" target="_blank">kjnodes.com</a>

::alert{variant="info"}

Once you downloaded the snapshot, you need to decompress it. You can use tools such as **lz4**.
To install lz4, launch:

::highlight-card

```bash
sudo apt-get install snapd lz4 -y
```
::

If the snapshot you downloaded is called **mainnet-archive-20230918.tar.lz4**, you can decompress it with **lz4** and move it in the **./archway/data** folder.

For example, if you have the snapshot in the downloads folder, you can use the following command:

::highlight-card

```bash
lz4 -d ~/downloads/mainnet-archive-20230918.tar.lz4 -o ~/.archway/data/mainnet-archive-20230918.tar
```
::

The above command decompress the snapshot in the **data** folder.

## Download the genesis file

You can download the genesis file from Github <a href="https://github.com/archway-network/networks/blob/main/archway-1/genesis/genesis.json.gz" target="_blank">Github</a>, for example by launching:
::highlight-card

```bash
wget https://github.com/archway-network/networks/blob/main/archway-1/genesis/genesis.json.gz
```

::

You can now decompress the genesis file with **gzip**
Move the genesis file to the **./archway/config** folder, for example with:
::highlight-card
```bash
gzip -dk genesis.json.gz
```

::


And then move the **genesis.json** file into the **./archway/config** folder, with: 
::highlight-card

```bash
mv genesis.json.gz /home/user/.archway/config/genesis.json
```

::

## Configure the node
In the **~/.archway/config** folder there you can find both the **app.toml** and **config.toml**.

In the app.toml, make sure to set the **minimum-gas-prices**, for example:
::highlight-card

```bash
minimum-gas-prices = "0.1arch"
```

::
This is the minimum gas prices that the validator is willing to accept for processing a transaction.


Also, make sure to check the p2p section in the **config.toml**.

You can find information about the p2p seeds in the chain.json file in <a href="https://github.com/archway-network/networks/blob/main/archway-1/chain.json" target="_blank">Github</a>.

## Start archwayd 


You can now initialize the node and choose a name for it (moniker) with:
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd init <node_name> --chain-id archway-1
```

::

::alert{variant="info"}
Before going any further, it is recommended to set up [Cosmovisor](/validators/running-a-node/cosmovisor) and run archwayd as a cosmovisor service.

```

 but it is highly recommended to start archwayd as a service and use cosmovisor.
### Start archwayd as a service

You can start the node as a service by creating a service file:
::highlight-card

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/archwayd.service

```

::
::highlight-card

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Archway Node
After=network.target

[Service]
User=$USER
Type=simple
ExecStart=$(which archwayd) start
Restart=on-failure
LimitNOFILE=65535

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```

::
Start the service by:
Reloading the daemon:
::highlight-card

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

```

::
Enable **archwayd**:
::highlight-card

```bash
sudo systemctl enable archwayd
```

::
Start **archwayd** as a service:
::highlight-card

```bash
sudo systemctl restart archwayd
```

::
Keep track of the logs:
::highlight-card

```bash
sudo journalctl -u archwayd -f -o cat
```

::


### Start archwayd docker as a service

A service file can be used to allow the automatic restart of the service, and it helps to enhance the reliability of your node.

You can create a service file with:

::highlight-card

```bash
nano /etc/systemd/system/archwayd.service

```

::




And add the following content to the file:

::highlight-card

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Archway Node
After=network-online.target
[Service]
User=$USER
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run --rm -it -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway
ghcr.io/archway-network/archwayd:$$archwayVersion$$
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=4096
[Install]WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

::

You can then reload the systemctl daemon:
::highlight-card

```bash

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

::

Enable the  service:

::highlight-card

```bash

sudo -S systemctl enable archwayd
```

::

And then start **archwayd** as a service:

::highlight-card

```bash

sudo systemctl start archwayd
```

::


You can then check that the service is properly running with:
::highlight-card

```bash

sudo systemctl status archwayd
```

::
