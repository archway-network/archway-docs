# Sync from snapshot
A snapshot is a compressed archive of the state of a blockchain node at a specific block height. Syncing a node with a snapshot speeds up the process of catching up with the network, as the node starts from the snapshot's block height instead of from the genesis block.


In order to sync your node through a snapshot, you will need to:
- Download the snapshot (from a trusted source).
- Start your node.

## Download the snapshot
You can download the latest snapshot from:
<a href="https://snapshots.archway.tech" target="_blank">snapshots.archway.tech</a>.

Also, you can use the snapshot maintained by the community:

- <a href="https://www.theamsolutions.info/archway-constantine" target="_blank">Theamsolutions.info</a>

- <a href="https://autostake.com/networks/testnets/archway/#services" target="_blank">Autostake</a>

- <a href="https://services.kjnodes.com/home/testnet/archway/snapshot" target="_blank">kjnodes.com</a>




## Start the node

### Start archwayd (default)

Now you can start the node with:
::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
Binary

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd start \
  --x-crisis-skip-assert-invariants
  --p2p.seeds aaa634d10eb2d0ca973441a17fa329dc33ebd5cf@34.134.104.171:26656 --unsafe-skip-upgrades 1492500
```
::
<!-- --unsafe-skip-upgrades 187340 -->
#title1
Docker

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run -v ${HOME}/.archway:/root/.archway -p 9091:9091 -p 9090:9090 -p 26656:26656 -p 26657:26657 -p 1317:1317 docker.io/archwaynetwork/archwayd:constantine \
  start \
  --p2p.seeds aaa634d10eb2d0ca973441a17fa329dc33ebd5cf@34.134.104.171:26656 --unsafe-skip-upgrades 1492500
```

### Start archwayd as a service

You can start the node as a service by creating a service file:
::highlight-card

```bash
sudo /etc/systemd/system/archwayd.service

```

::
::highlight-card

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Archway Node
After=network.target

[Service]
User=$USER
Type=simple
ExecStart=$(which archwayd) start
Restart=on-failure
LimitNOFILE=65535

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```

::
Start the service by:
Reloading the daemon:
::highlight-card

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

```

::
Enable **archwayd**:
::highlight-card

```bash
sudo systemctl enable archwayd
```

::
Start **archwayd** as a service:
::highlight-card

```bash
sudo systemctl restart archwayd
```

::
Keep track of the logs:
::highlight-card

```bash
sudo journalctl -u archwayd -f -o cat
```

::


### Start archwayd docker as a service

A service file can be used to allow the automatic restart of the service, and it helps to enhance the reliability of your node.

You can create a service file with:

::highlight-card

```bash
nano /etc/systemd/system/archwayd.service

```

::




And add the following content to the file:

::highlight-card

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Archway Node
After=network-online.target
[Service]
User=$USER
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run --rm -it -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway
archwaynetwork/archwayd:latest
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=4096
[Install]WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

::

You can then reload the systemctl daemon:
::highlight-card

```bash

sudo -S systemctl daemon-reload
```

::

Enable the  service:

::highlight-card

```bash

sudo -S systemctl enable archwayd
```

::

And then start **archwayd** as a service:

::highlight-card

```bash

sudo systemctl start archwayd
```

::


You can then check that the service is properly running with:
::highlight-card

```bash

sudo systemctl status archwayd
```

::
