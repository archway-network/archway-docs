# Sync from genesis

This is the slowest (and most secure) way to sync your node, as your node goes through every block since the genesis block.

Before going any further, it is recommended to set up [Cosmovisor](/validators/running-a-node/cosmovisor).

You can use the [Networks page](../../resources/networks) to find useful information such as the **chain-id** and  **rpc-url** of the network you would like to connect to.

With the above data, make sure to download correct genesis file, by fetching it from an available node:

::highlight-card

```bash
curl -s "$RPC_ENDPOINT/genesis" | jq '.result.genesis' > ~/.archway/config/genesis.json
```

::


## Constantine Genesis file

You can find relevant information regarding **constantine-3** on <a href="https://github.com/archway-network/networks/tree/main/constantine-3" target="_blank">Github</a>.
For example, you can launch the command to connect to the RPC Endpoint of the Constantine network, and download the Genesis File:
::highlight-card

```bash
curl -s https://rpc.constantine.archway.tech/genesis |jq -r .result.genesis > ${HOME}/.archway/config/genesis.json
```

::


You can also download the genesis file from github, for example by launching:
::highlight-card

```bash
wget https://github.com/archway-network/networks/blob/main/constantine-3/genesis.json
```

::

## Start the node

### Start archwayd (default)


Start the archway and join the network:

::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
Binary

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd start \
  --p2p.seeds Address1@Host_Name_OR_IP1:PORT1, ...AddressN@Host_Name_OR_IPN:PORTN \
```
::

#title1
Docker

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway ghcr.io/archway-network/archwayd:v1.0.0-rc.3 \
  start \
  --p2p.seeds Address1@Host_Name_OR_IP1:PORT1, ...AddressN@Host_Name_OR_IPN:PORTN \
```

::

::

Below is the command to join the **Constantine testnet**:

::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
Binary

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd start \
  --p2p.seeds e8d60ff778f3c27f54382ff22c7ac071f2a81027@35.223.36.227:26656
```
::

<!-- --unsafe-skip-upgrades 187340 -->


#title1
Docker

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run -v ${HOME}/.archway:/root/.archway -p 9091:9091 -p 9090:9090 -p 26656:26656 -p 26657:26657 -p 1317:1317 ghcr.io/archway-network/archwayd:v1.0.0-rc.3 \
  start \
  --p2p.seeds aaa634d10eb2d0ca973441a17fa329dc33ebd5cf@34.134.104.171:26656
```
<!-- --unsafe-skip-upgrades 187340 -->
::

::


<!--Please note that currently the flag **--unsafe-skip-upgrades 187340** is needed to correctly sync your node. Alternatively, you can directly sync from that specific block, for example by adding the flag: **--halt-height 187341** instead.
-->


### Start archwayd as a service

A service file can be used to allow the automatic restart of the service, and it helps to enhance the reliability of your node.

You can create a service file with:

::highlight-card

```bash
nano /etc/systemd/system/archwayd.service

```

::




And add the following content to the file:

::highlight-card

```service
[Unit]
Description=Archway Node
After=network-online.target
[Service]
User=$USER
ExecStart=/home/$USER/go/bin/archwayd start
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=4096
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```

::

You can then reload the systemctl daemon:
::highlight-card

```bash

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

::

Enable the  service:

::highlight-card

```bash

sudo -S systemctl enable archwayd
```

::

And then start **archwayd** as a service:

::highlight-card

```bash

sudo systemctl start archwayd
```

::


You can then check that the service is properly running with:
::highlight-card

```bash

sudo systemctl status archwayd
```

::



### Start archwayd docker as a service

A service file can be used to allow the automatic restart of the service, and it helps to enhance the reliability of your node.

You can create a service file with:

::highlight-card

```bash
nano /etc/systemd/system/archwayd.service

And add the following content to the file:

::highlight-card

```bash

ghcr.io/archway-network/archwayd:v1.0.0-rc.3
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=4096
[Install]WantedBy=multi-user.target

```

::


You can then reload the systemctl daemon:
::highlight-card

```bash

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

::



Enable the  service:

::highlight-card

```bash

sudo -S systemctl enable archwayd
```

::

And then start **archwayd** as a service:

::highlight-card

```bash

sudo systemctl start archwayd
```

::


You can then check that the service is properly running with:
::highlight-card

```bash

sudo systemctl status archwayd
```

::




## Cleaning up (optional)

In case you want to remove any previous genesis file and configuration that you have used, you can clean up the network.

::highlight-card

```bash
rm -rf ~/.archway
```

::

::alert{variant="warning"}
This command will remove all data and configs you already set.
#title
Warning

## Next Steps
Now that you have joined a network, you can [start validating](/validators/becoming-a-validator/overview).
