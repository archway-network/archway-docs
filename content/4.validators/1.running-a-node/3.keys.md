## Prepare the Account and Keys


Create a key to hold your account. Once you run this command, you may be prompted with a password dialogue, where you need to set up a password for your keyring. This password encrypts the private key of your node.

::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
Binary

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd keys add <account-name>
```

::

#title1
Docker

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway archwaynetwork/archwayd:$NETWORK_NAME \
  keys add <account-name>
```

::

::

For example:


::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
Binary

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd keys add my-node
```

::

#title1
Docker

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway archwaynetwork/archwayd:constantine \
  keys add my-node
```

::

You see an output similar to the following:
::highlight-card

```text
- name: my-account
  type: local
  address: archway12ntzpk9fjt2x39pvll8ufma9tuhhnkh8g4zzc2
  pubkey: archwaypub1addwnpepqfgjegqxxv9srfe359t93tu9l86tpkwwjk7w63xtpwq05wmlq9emjmxfmmv
  mnemonic: ""
  threshold: 0
  pubkeys: []


**Important:** Write this mnemonic phrase in a safe place.
It is the only way to recover your account if you ever forget your password.

Here you can see your account details and the mnemonic phrase that is very crucial to recover the account.


::alert{variant="info"}
In rare circumstances, when using in Ubuntu the OS Keyring Backend may
throw the error: ```"object does not exist at path “/“ error."``` 
If this was the case, you can change the
keyring backend from OS to file, and then launch every command with the `--keyring-backend file`
flag.

## Next Steps

Now you are ready to [join a network](join-a-network).
Optionally, you can take your time to [configure your node](/validators/running-a-node/configure), so that the validator can be customized according to your needs and preferences.
Also, note that you can use [Cosmovisor](/validators/becoming-a-validator/cosmovisor) in order to perform automatic upgrades.
