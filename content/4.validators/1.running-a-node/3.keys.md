## Prepare the Account and Keys


Create a key to hold your account. Once you run this command, you may be prompted with a password dialogue, where you need to set up a password for your keyring. This password encrypts the private key of your node.

::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
Binary

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd keys add <account-name>
```

::

#title1
Docker

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway archwaynetwork/archwayd:$NETWORK_NAME \
  keys add <account-name>
```

::

::

For example:


::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
Binary

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd keys add my-node
```

::

#title1
Docker

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway archwaynetwork/archwayd:constantine \
  keys add my-node
```

::

::



You see an output similar to the following:
::highlight-card

```text
- name: my-account
  type: local
  address: archway12ntzpk9fjt2x39pvll8ufma9tuhhnkh8g4zzc2
  pubkey: archwaypub1addwnpepqfgjegqxxv9srfe359t93tu9l86tpkwwjk7w63xtpwq05wmlq9emjmxfmmv
  mnemonic: ""
  threshold: 0
  pubkeys: []


**Important:** Write this mnemonic phrase in a safe place.
It is the only way to recover your account if you ever forget your password.

```

::

The key comes with a human-readable 24-word **mnemonic phrase** (also called **seed** or simply **mnemonic**), which you can use to recover the associated addresses.



::alert{variant="warning"}
Make sure to safely back up the mnemonic phrase, as it is crucial to recover your account if keys are lost
#title
Warning
::

::alert{variant="info"}
In rare circumstances, when using Ubuntu the OS Keyring Backend may
throw the error: ```"object does not exist at path “/“ error."``` 
If this was the case, you can change the
keyring backend from OS to file, and then launch every command with the `--keyring-backend file`
flag.

## Restore existing key by mnemonic

To recover an existing account, add the **--recover** flag:



::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
Binary

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd keys add <key_name> --recover
```

::

#title1
Docker

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway archwaynetwork/archwayd:$NETWORK_NAME \
  keys add <key_name> --recover
```

::

::

You will be prompted to enter your bip39 mnemonic in order to add the key.


## List your keys

As you can store several keys from the same mnemonic, you can use the following command to see list them:


::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
Binary

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd keys list
```

::

#title1
Docker

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway archwaynetwork/archwayd:$NETWORK_NAME \
  keys list
```

::

::


and you will be shown an output similar to this:
::highlight-card
```bash

$ archwayd keys list
  - name: Default
    type: local
    address: ## Address of "Default" ##
    pubkey: ## Pubkey of "Default" ##
    mnemonic: ""
    threshold: 0
    pubkeys: []
  - name: Default_restore
    type: local
    address: ## Address of "Default_restore" ##
    pubkey: ## Pubkey of "Default_restore" ##
    mnemonic: ""
    threshold: 0
    pubkeys: []


```
::
You can also retrieve a specific key's information:


::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
Binary

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd keys show <key_name>
```

::

#title1
Docker

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway archwaynetwork/archwayd:$NETWORK_NAME \
 keys show <key_name>
```

::

::


and you will be shown something similar to the following:

::highlight-card
```bash
$ archwayd keys show Default --bech acc
- name: Default
  type: local
  address: arch1quw5r22pxy8znjtdkgqc65atrm3x5hg6vycm5n
  pubkey: archpub1addwnpepqdct05khsxvtaaj0stuvayrpw0j8t6styr7vu05k3y63d5540ftuz8x6tsq
  mnemonic: ""
  threshold: 0
  pubkeys: []
```
::


## Delete a key
You can delete a key in your storage path with:


::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
Binary

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd keys delete <key_name>
```

::

#title1
Docker

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway archwaynetwork/archwayd:$NETWORK_NAME \
keys delete <key_name>
```

::

::


::alert{variant="warning"}
I
Make sure you are fully aware of the implications and have backed up the key mnemonic before removing any of your keys. There is no way to recover your key without the mnemonic.

## Export private keys

You can export and backup your key by launching:


::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
Binary

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd keys export <key_name>
```

::

#title1
Docker

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway archwaynetwork/archwayd:$NETWORK_NAME \
keys export <key_name>
```

::

::


## Keyring-backend flag

The Keyring is where the keys are being stored, and you have different options for it. 
::highlight-card
```bash
archwayd keys [subcommands] --keyring-backend [backend type]
```
::
### os backend

The default **os** backend stores the keys in the operating system's credential sub-system (wheter is macOS or GNU/linux).

### file backend
By choosing the **file** backend, a password entry is required every time you need to access it. This implies that you may be prompted for your password multiple times in one single command.

### test backend
The **test** backend is a password-less variation of the file backend. It stores unencrypted keys inside the app's configuration directory. It should only be used in testing environments and never be used in production.



## Next Steps

Now you are ready to [join a network](join-a-network).
Optionally, you can take your time to [configure your node](/validators/running-a-node/configure), so that the validator can be customized according to your needs and preferences.
Also, note that you can use [Cosmovisor](/validators/becoming-a-validator/cosmovisor) in order to perform automatic upgrades.
