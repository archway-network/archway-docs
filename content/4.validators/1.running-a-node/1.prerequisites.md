# Prerequisites

This guide explains what are the requirements to install and run an Archway full node.


## Hardware requirements:

The following hardware requirements are expected:

- x86-64 (amd64) multi-core CPU (AMD / Intel);
- 64GB RAM;
- 1TB NVMe SSD Storage;
- 100Mbps bi-directional Internet connection;

## Installing Prerequisites

Below are the packages that your machine needs to complete the installation process.
::highlight-card

```bash
# updates and upgrades the list of local packages
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt upgrade -y

#installs docker, build-essential package and git
sudo apt-get install build-essential docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin git

```

## Installing Go

Go Version 1.16 or higher is required to run an Archway node. Please find a <a href="https://golang.org/doc/install" target="_blank">guide here</a>
 on how to install Go.

Ensure the Go environment variables are <a href="https://golang.org/doc/gopath_code#GOPATH" target="_blank">set properly</a>
 on your system.

As an example, you may need to install Go by running:

::highlight-card

```bash

sudo apt install golang-go
```

::

and set up the **GOPATH** by launching:


::highlight-card

```bash
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin:$GOPATH/bin
```

::


or:
::highlight-card

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
```

::
and applying those changes with:
::highlight-card
```bash
source ~/.profile
```
::
## Docker (optional)

You can also install **archwayd** by using <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker" target="_blank" title="Install Docker">Docker</a>.





::alert{variant="warning"}
For Linux users, it's recommended to run the Docker daemon in <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/" target="_blank" title="Docker Rootless mode">Rootless Mode</a>.
