# Prerequisites

This guide explains what the requirements are to install and run an Archway full node.


## Hardware requirements:

The following hardware requirements are expected:

- x86-64 (amd64) multi-core CPU (AMD / Intel)
- 64GB RAM
- 1TB NVMe SSD Storage
- 100Mbps bi-directional Internet connection

## Install prerequisites

Below are the packages that your machine needs in order to complete the installation process.
::highlight-card

```bash
# updates and upgrades the list of local packages
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# installs docker, build-essential and git
sudo apt-get install build-essential docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin git

```

## Installing go

**Go** version **1.16** or higher is required if not installing **archwayd** via **Docker**. Please refer to this <a href='https://golang.org/doc/install' target='_blank'>guide</a> on how to install Go.

Ensure the Go environment variables are <a href="https://golang.org/doc/gopath_code#GOPATH" target="_blank">set properly</a> on your system.

As an example, on **Ubuntu**, you can install **Go** and configure the **GOPATH** by doing the following:

::highlight-card

```bash

sudo apt install golang-go
```

::

Set the **GOROOT** and **GOPATH** in the **~/.profile** file:


::highlight-card

```bash
export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin:$GOPATH/bin
```

::

Apply these changes using:
::highlight-card
```bash
source ~/.profile
```
::


## Next Steps
You are ready to go! Let's go forward with installing [**archwayd**](2.install.md).
