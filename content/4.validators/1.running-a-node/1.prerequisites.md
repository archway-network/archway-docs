# Prerequisites

This guide explains what the requirements are to install and run an Archway full node.


## Hardware requirements:

The following hardware requirements are expected:

- x86-64 (amd64) multi-core CPU (AMD / Intel)
- 64GB RAM
- 1TB NVMe SSD Storage
- 100Mbps bi-directional Internet connection

## Install prerequisites

You can obtain **archwayd** by either:
- Downloading the pre-built binary via the available <a href="https://github.com/archway-network/archway/releases" target="_blank">releases</a> (preferred) .
- Building the binary by using <a href="https://go.dev" target="_blank">GoLang</a>
- Using the container image via <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/" target="_blank">Docker</a>

### Downloading the pre-built binary

If you wish to use the pre-built binary, no specific dependency is required. 
Just make sure to update your local packages and installing the **build-essential** and **git** packages.

::highlight-card
```bash
# updates and upgrades the list of local packages
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
::

::highlight-card
```bash
# installs docker, build-essential and git
sudo apt-get install build-essential git
```
::

You can download the correct pre-built binary by looking at the available binaries in the <a href="https://github.com/archway-network/archway/releases" target="_blank">releases</a> page.

and download the binary by either clicking on it or using **wget**, for example:

::highlight-card
```bash
wget https://github.com/archway-network/archway/releases/download/v0.5.2/archwayd_linux_amd64
```
::

Please make sure to download the latest binary.

### Building the binary with GoLang

If you wish to build the binary yourself:
1) Make sure to update your local packages and installing the **build-essential** and **git** packages:

::highlight-card
```bash
# updates and upgrades the list of local packages
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
::

::highlight-card
```bash
# installs docker, build-essential and git
sudo apt-get install build-essential git
```
::


2) Install **Go** version **1.16** or higher. Please refer to this <a href='https://golang.org/doc/install' target='_blank'>guide</a> on how to install **Go**. 

3) Ensure the Go environment variables are <a href="https://golang.org/doc/gopath_code#GOPATH" target="_blank">set properly</a> on your system.

As an example, on **Ubuntu**, you can install **Go** and configure the **GOPATH** by doing the following:

::highlight-card

```bash

sudo apt install golang-go
```

::

Set the **GOROOT** and **GOPATH** in the **~/.profile** file:


::highlight-card

```bash
export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin:$GOPATH/bin
```

::

Apply these changes using:
::highlight-card
```bash
source ~/.profile
```
::


### Using thr container image via Docker

If you prefer using <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/" target="_blank">Docker</a>, make sure to update your local packages and installing the required **docker**, **build-essential** and **git** packages:

::highlight-card
```bash
# updates and upgrades the list of local packages
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
::


::highlight-card
```bash
# installs docker, build-essential and git
sudo apt-get install build-essential docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin git
```
::

## Next steps
You are ready to go! Let's go forward with installing [**archwayd**](2.install.md).
