# Prerequisites

This guide explains what are the requirements to install and run an Archway full node.


## Hardware requirements:

The following hardware requirements are expected:
- Linux distribution
- x86_64 processor
- 16 GB RAM
- 500 GB to 2 TB storage\*
- Storage size for validators depends on the level of desired pruning.

## Installing Go

Go Version 1.16 or higher is required to run an Archway node. Please find a <a href="https://golang.org/doc/install" target="_blank">guide here</a>
 on how to install Go.

Ensure the Go environment variables are <a href="https://golang.org/doc/gopath_code#GOPATH" target="_blank">set properly</a>
 on your system.

As an example, you may need to install Go by running:

```sudo apt install go```

and set up the `GOPATH` by launching:

```bash
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin:$GOPATH/bin
```

or:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
```

and applying those changes with:

```bash
source ~/.profile
```

## Docker (optional)

You can also install **archwayd** by using <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker" target="_blank" title="Install Docker">Docker</a>.
