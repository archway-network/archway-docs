Description: Instructions for installing and running a validator node on the Archway blockchain network

## Initialize the node

A **moniker** is a human-readable name that represents the validator node. It's a way to identify your validator to other participants in the network, much like a username or a handle. It's intended to be easier to remember and recognize than the validator's public key or operator address, which are long and difficult to distinguish at a glance. The **moniker** shows the activity of your node on the block explorer.

::alert{variant="info"}
This step is not needed if you just want to run a node without validating.

You can set up the **moniker** of your node by launching the following command:

::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
Binary

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd init <moniker> --chain-id <chain>
```

::

#title1
Docker

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway ghcr.io/archway-network/archwayd:v1.0.0-rc.3 init <moniker> --chain-id <chain>
```

::

::

To connect to a specific network, you would need to change the **\<chain\>** accordingly.

For example, for the **Triomphe** mainnet network you would launch:

::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
Binary

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd init my-node --chain-id archway-1
```

::

#title1
Docker

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run -v ${HOME}/.archway:/root/.archway ghcr.io/archway-network/archwayd:v1.0.0  init my-cool-moniker --chain-id archway-1
```

::

::







While for the **Constantine** testnet network you would launch:

::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
Binary

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd init my-node --chain-id constantine-3
```

::

#title1
Docker

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run -v ${HOME}/.archway:/root/.archway ghcr.io/archway-network/archwayd:v1.0.0  init my-cool-moniker --chain-id constantine-3
```

You can now set up the [node keys](/validators/running-a-node/keys).
