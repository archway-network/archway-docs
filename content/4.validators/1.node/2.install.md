# Node Installation

This guide explains how to install and run an Archway full node.


## Build archwayd from Source


### **Clone the repository**
Now let's get the source code from the <a href="https://github.com/archway-network/archway" target="_blank">Archway Repository</a>.
::highlight-card

```bash

git clone https://github.com/archway-network/archway.git

cd archway

git fetch

git checkout <version-tag>

```

::
::alert{variant="info"}
For connecting to the [Constantine Developer Testnet](https://docs.archway.io/docs/overview/network#constantine-dapp-developer-testnet), the version tag v0.2.0 should be used:

`git checkout v0.2.0`

#title
INFO
::

### **Build archwayd**
Let's build and install the `archwayd` daemon:
::highlight-card

```bash
make install
```

::
Confirm that the installation has been completed by running the following command:
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd version

#1.2.3
```

::

## Build archwayd with Docker

Make sure you have <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker" target="_blank" title="Install Docker">Docker</a> installed on your machine. For Linux users, it's recommended to run the Docker daemon in  <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/" target="_blank" title="Docker Rootless mode">Rootless Mode</a>.


### **Pull the Docker image**

Pull the image from <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/archwaynetwork/archwayd" target="_blank">Docker Hub</a>
:

Each Archway network uses a different version of Archway. To connect your node to a network, you should use a tag with the corresponding network name.



 For example, to connect to the Constantine testnet:
::highlight-card

```bash
docker pull archwaynetwork/archwayd:constantine
```

::
::alert{variant="info"}
Make sure to always use the image tag that points to the network you want to connect.
#title
INFO
::


Please note that the latest Docker image corresponds to the Titus experimental testnet. Titus is not completely stable, and it is suggested not relying on it.

::highlight-card

```bash
docker pull archwaynetwork/archwayd:latest
```

::

### **Set up the PATH**


By default, the Docker image runs the `archwayd` binary, so you should specify the arguments for `archwayd` right after the image name. For better usage, mount an external volume at `/root/.archway` to persist the daemon home path across different runs. For example, if you want to add a key:
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway \
  archwaynetwork/archwayd:latest \
  keys add test-key
```

::
And then list all keys:
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway \
  archwaynetwork/archwayd:latest \
  keys list
```

::
It's also important to notice that, when running a node in a network, you'll need to expose the container ports for external connectivity. The image exposes the following ports:

- `1317`: Rest server
- `26656`: Tendermint P2P
- `26657`: Tendermint RPC

::alert{variant="success"}
To simplify using the Docker container, you can set an alias with the home path and the proper image tag (replacing `<network-name>`), like:
::highlight-card

```bash
alias archwayd="docker run --rm -it -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway archwaynetwork/archwayd:<network-name>"
```

::

#title
TIP
::

After setting the alias with the above tip, you can use the other `archwayd` commands without typing the verbose Docker run command.
For the sake of a comprehensive documentation, the full Docker command is shown. Just remember that by setting the alias you can simply use `archwayd` instead of the Docker command :)













## Initialize the Node


Initialize the **genesis.json** file that is required to establish a network.
You will also need to choose a **moniker** for your node, which is the name that will appear on the blockexplorer once you will start validating.
::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
Binary

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd init <moniker> --chain-id <chain>
```

::

#title1
Docker

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway archwaynetwork/archwayd:$NETWORK_NAME \
  init <moniker> --chain-id <chain>
```

::

::

For example, for the Constaine network:

::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
Binary

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd init my-cool-moniker --chain-id constantine
```

::

#title1
Docker

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run -v ${HOME}/.archway:/root/.archway docker.io/archwaynetwork/archwayd:constantine  init my-cool-moniker --chain-id constantine-1
```

::

::


<!-- ## Starting the Node

Starting a node now will give you an error message like the one below. This is because at least one validator node must be connected for the network to run.
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd start

Error: error during handshake: error on replay: validator set is nil in genesis and still empty after InitChain
```

::

## Next Steps

It is reccommendable to take your time to [configure your node](2.configure.md). This is where the fun stuff happens, and where your validator can be customized according to your needs and preferences.

After you feel comfortable with your configuration, you can either:
Connect to a network, see the [Validator Overview](../validator/overview.md) on how to run a validator node.

Test your node [running a local testnet](../validator/running-a-local-testnet) with two nodes.
