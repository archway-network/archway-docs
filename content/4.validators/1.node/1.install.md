# Node Installation

This guide explains how to install and run an Archway full node.

## Installing Prerequisites

Below are the packages that your machine needs to complete the installation process.
::highlight-card

```bash
# updates and upgrades the list of local packages
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt upgrade -y

#installs docker, build-essential package and git
sudo apt-get install build-essential docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin git

```

::

## Installing Go

Go Version 1.16 or higher is required to run an Archway node. Please find a [guide here](https://golang.org/doc/install) on how to install Go.

Ensure the Go environment variables are [set properly](https://golang.org/doc/gopath_code#GOPATH) on your system.

## Build Archway Daemon from Source

The next step is to get the source code from the [Archway Repository](https://github.com/archway-network/archway).
::highlight-card

```bash

git clone https://github.com/archway-network/archway.git

cd archway

git fetch

git checkout <version-tag>

```

::
::alert{variant="info"}
For connecting to the [Constantine Developer Testnet](https://docs.archway.io/docs/overview/network#constantine-dapp-developer-testnet), the version tag v0.2.0 should be used:

`git checkout v0.2.0`

#title
INFO
::

Build and install that Archway Daemon
::highlight-card

```bash
make install
```

::
Confirm that the installation has been completed by running the following command:
::highlight-card

```bash
archway --version

#1.2.3
```

::

## Run `archwayd` using Docker

Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker 'Install Docker') installed on your machine. For Linux users, it's recommended to run the Docker daemon in [Rootless Mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/ 'Docker Rootless mode').

Pull the image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/archwaynetwork/archwayd):
::highlight-card

```bash
docker pull archwaynetwork/archwayd:latest
```

::
Each Archway network uses a different version of Archway. To connect your node to a network, you should use a tag with the corresponding network name. For example, to connect to the Constantine testnet:
::highlight-card

```bash
docker pull archwaynetwork/archwayd:constantine
```

::
::alert{variant="info"}
Make sure to always use the image tag that points to the network you want to connect.
#title
INFO
::

By default, the Docker image runs the `archwayd` binary, so you should specify the arguments for `archwayd` right after the image name. For better usage, mount an external volume at `/root/.archway` to persist the daemon home path across different runs. For example, if you want to add a key:
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway \
  archwaynetwork/archwayd:latest \
  keys add test-key
```

::
And then list all keys:
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway \
  archwaynetwork/archwayd:latest \
  keys list
```

::
It's also important to notice that, when running a node in a network, you'll need to expose the container ports for external connectivity. The image exposes the following ports:

- `1317`: Rest server
- `26656`: Tendermint P2P
- `26657`: Tendermint RPC

::alert{variant="success"}
To simplify using the Docker container, set an alias with the home path and the proper image tag (replacing `<network-name>`), like:
::highlight-card

```bash
alias archwayd="docker run --rm -it -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway archwaynetwork/archwayd:<network-name>"
```

::
After setting this alias, you can use the other `archwayd` commands without typing the verbose Docker run command.
#title
TIP
::

## Initialize the Node

Initialize the `genesis.json` file that is required to establish a network.
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd init my-node --chain-id my-chain
```

::
If you recieve a `archwayd: command not found` Error message, run the follwoing command:
::highlight-card

```bash
sudo cp /$HOME/go/bin/archwayd /usr/local/bin
```

::
If the command is run successfully, you will see the information about your chain starting with a similar message:
::highlight-card

```bash
{"app_message":{"auth":{"accounts":[],"params":{"max_memo_characters":"256","sig_verify_cost_ed25519":"590","sig_verify_cost_secp256k1":"1000","tx_sig_limit":"7","tx_size_cost_per_byte":"10"}}....

```

::

## Prepare the Account and Keys

Create a key to hold your account. After you run this command, you are prompted with a password dialogue. Enter a new password for your account.
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd keys add my-account
```

::
You see an output similar to the following:
::highlight-card

```text
- name: my-account
  type: local
  address: archway12ntzpk9fjt2x39pvll8ufma9tuhhnkh8g4zzc2
  pubkey: archwaypub1addwnpepqfgjegqxxv9srfe359t93tu9l86tpkwwjk7w63xtpwq05wmlq9emjmxfmmv
  mnemonic: ""
  threshold: 0
  pubkeys: []


**Important:** Write this mnemonic phrase in a safe place.
It is the only way to recover your account if you ever forget your password.

```

::
Here you can see your account details and the mnemonic phrase that is very crucial to recover the account.

## Starting the Node

Starting a node now will give you an error message like the one below. This is because at least one validator node must be connected for the network to run.
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd start

Error: error during handshake: error on replay: validator set is nil in genesis and still empty after InitChain
```

::

## Next Steps

To get your node fully running, you can [run a local testnet](https://docs.archway.io/docs/node/running-a-local-testnet) with two nodes.

If you would like to connect to a network, see the [Validator Overview](../validator/overview.md) on how to run a validator node.
