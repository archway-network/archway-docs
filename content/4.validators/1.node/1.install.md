# Node Installation

This guide explains how to install and run an Archway full node.


## Hardware requirements:

The following hardware requirements are expected:
- Linux distribution
- x86_64 processor
- 16 GB RAM
- 500 GB to 2 TB storage\*
- Storage size for validators depends on the level of desired pruning.

## Installing Prerequisites

Below are the packages that your machine needs to complete the installation process.
::highlight-card

```bash
# updates and upgrades the list of local packages
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt upgrade -y

#installs docker, build-essential package and git
sudo apt-get install build-essential docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin git

```

::

## Installing Go

Go Version 1.16 or higher is required to run an Archway node. Please find a [guide here](https://golang.org/doc/install) on how to install Go.

Ensure the Go environment variables are [set properly](https://golang.org/doc/gopath_code#GOPATH) on your system.

As an example, you may need to install Go by running:
`sudo apt install go`

and set up the GOPATH by launching:
`export GOPATH=$HOME/go`
`export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin:$GOPATH/bin`

or:
`export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin`

and applying those changes:
`source ~/.profile`



## Build `archwayd`

### Build `archwayd` daemon from Source

The next step is to get the source code from the [Archway Repository](https://github.com/archway-network/archway).
::highlight-card

```bash

git clone https://github.com/archway-network/archway.git

cd archway

git fetch

git checkout <version-tag>

```

::
::alert{variant="info"}
For connecting to the [Constantine Developer Testnet](https://docs.archway.io/docs/overview/network#constantine-dapp-developer-testnet), the version tag v0.2.0 should be used:

`git checkout v0.2.0`

#title
INFO
::

Build and install the `archwayd` daemon
::highlight-card

```bash
make install
```

::
Confirm that the installation has been completed by running the following command:
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd version

#1.2.3
```

::

### Run `archwayd` using Docker

Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker 'Install Docker') installed on your machine. For Linux users, it's recommended to run the Docker daemon in [Rootless Mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/ 'Docker Rootless mode').

Pull the image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/archwaynetwork/archwayd):

Each Archway network uses a different version of Archway. To connect your node to a network, you should use a tag with the corresponding network name.



 For example, to connect to the Constantine testnet:
::highlight-card

```bash
docker pull archwaynetwork/archwayd:constantine
```

::
::alert{variant="info"}
Make sure to always use the image tag that points to the network you want to connect.
#title
INFO
::


Please note that the latest Docker image corresponds to the Titus experimental testnet. Titus is not completely stable, and it is suggested not relying on it.

::highlight-card

```bash
docker pull archwaynetwork/archwayd:latest
```

::

By default, the Docker image runs the `archwayd` binary, so you should specify the arguments for `archwayd` right after the image name. For better usage, mount an external volume at `/root/.archway` to persist the daemon home path across different runs. For example, if you want to add a key:
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway \
  archwaynetwork/archwayd:latest \
  keys add test-key
```

::
And then list all keys:
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway \
  archwaynetwork/archwayd:latest \
  keys list
```

::
It's also important to notice that, when running a node in a network, you'll need to expose the container ports for external connectivity. The image exposes the following ports:

- `1317`: Rest server
- `26656`: Tendermint P2P
- `26657`: Tendermint RPC

::alert{variant="success"}
To simplify using the Docker container, set an alias with the home path and the proper image tag (replacing `<network-name>`), like:
::highlight-card

```bash
alias archwayd="docker run --rm -it -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway archwaynetwork/archwayd:<network-name>"
```

::
After setting this alias, you can use the other `archwayd` commands without typing the verbose Docker run command.
#title
TIP
::

For the sake of a comprehensive documentation, the full Docker command is shown. Just remember that by setting the alias you can simply use `archwayd` instead of the Docker command :)

## Initialize the Node

### Initialize from source

Initialize the `genesis.json` file that is required to establish a network.
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd init moniker --chain-id my-chain
```
<!--::
For example, if you want to initialize your node on the `Constantine` network:
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd init my-node --chain-id constantine-1
```
::
MOVED INSIDE THE TAB SECTION-->

<!--
::highlight-card

```bash
sudo cp /$HOME/go/bin/archwayd /usr/local/bin
```

::
If the command is run successfully, you will see the information about your chain starting with a similar message:
::highlight-card

::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}

::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd init my-node --chain-id my-chain
```

For example, if you want to initialize your node on the `Constantine` network:
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd init my-node --chain-id constantine-1
```

::alert{variant="info"}
The `moniker` is the name of your validator that you can choose and will show up in the explorer.

### Initialize from Docker

Using Docker, here is how to initialize the node for the Constantine Testnet:
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run -v ${HOME}/.archway:/root/.archway docker.io/archwaynetwork/archwayd:constantin  init mybeautfimoniker --chain-id constantine-1
```

::



A similar message should now be displayed:
```bash
{"app_message":{"auth":{"accounts":[],"params":{"max_memo_characters":"256","sig_verify_cost_ed25519":"590","sig_verify_cost_secp256k1":"1000","tx_sig_limit":"7","tx_size_cost_per_byte":"10"}}....

```

## Prepare the Account and Keys

Create a key to hold your account. After you run this command, you are prompted with a password dialogue.

Create a key to hold your account. Once you run this command, your may be prompted with a password dialogue, where you need to set up a password for your keyring. This password encrypts the private key of your node.

::highlight-card

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway archwaynetwork/archwayd:$NETWORK_NAME \

::

For Constantine:

::highlight-card

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway archwaynetwork/archwayd:constantine \
  keys add my-validator-account
```

::


You see an output similar to the following:
::highlight-card

```text
- name: my-account
  type: local
  address: archway12ntzpk9fjt2x39pvll8ufma9tuhhnkh8g4zzc2
  pubkey: archwaypub1addwnpepqfgjegqxxv9srfe359t93tu9l86tpkwwjk7w63xtpwq05wmlq9emjmxfmmv
  mnemonic: ""
  threshold: 0
  pubkeys: []


**Important:** Write this mnemonic phrase in a safe place.
It is the only way to recover your account if you ever forget your password.

Here you can see your account details and the mnemonic phrase that is very crucial to recover the account.

<!-- ## Starting the Node

Starting a node now will give you an error message like the one below. This is because at least one validator node must be connected for the network to run.
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd start

Error: error during handshake: error on replay: validator set is nil in genesis and still empty after InitChain
```

::
THIS SECTION IS CONFUSING

## Next Steps

It is reccommendable to take your time to [configure your node](/6.node/2.configure.md). This is where the fun stuff happens, and where your validator can be customized according to your needs and preferences.

After you feel comfortable with your configuration, you can either:
Connect to a network, see the [Validator Overview](../validator/overview.md) on how to run a validator node.

Test your node [running a local testnet](https://docs.archway.io/docs/node/running-a-local-testnet) with two nodes.
