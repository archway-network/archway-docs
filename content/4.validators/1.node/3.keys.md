## Prepare the Account and Keys

Create a key to hold your account. After you run this command, you are prompted with a password dialogue.

Create a key to hold your account. Once you run this command, your may be prompted with a password dialogue, where you need to set up a password for your keyring. This password encrypts the private key of your node.

::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
Binary

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd keys add <account-name>
```

::

#title1
Docker

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway archwaynetwork/archwayd:$NETWORK_NAME \
  keys add <account-name>
```

::

For example:


::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
Binary

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd keys add my-node
```

::

#title1
Docker

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway archwaynetwork/archwayd:constantine \
  keys add my-node
```

::

You see an output similar to the following:
::highlight-card

```text
- name: my-account
  type: local
  address: archway12ntzpk9fjt2x39pvll8ufma9tuhhnkh8g4zzc2
  pubkey: archwaypub1addwnpepqfgjegqxxv9srfe359t93tu9l86tpkwwjk7w63xtpwq05wmlq9emjmxfmmv
  mnemonic: ""
  threshold: 0
  pubkeys: []


**Important:** Write this mnemonic phrase in a safe place.

Here you can see your account details and the mnemonic phrase that is very crucial to recover the account.

## Next Steps

It is reccommendable to take your time to [configure your node](2.configure.md). This is where the fun stuff happens, and where your validator can be customized according to your needs and preferences.

After you feel comfortable with your configuration, you can either:

- Connect to a network, see the [Validator Overview](../validator/overview.md) on how to run a validator node.

- Test your node [running a local testnet](../validator/running-a-local-testnet) with two nodes.
