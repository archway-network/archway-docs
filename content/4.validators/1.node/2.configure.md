# Node Configuration

By default, the `init` command creates your `~/.archway` directory with subfolders `config` and `data`. In the config directory, the most important files for configuration are `app.toml` and `config.toml`. You can configure your node via editing these files.

The basic configurations are included in this document. For more details about configs, review the `app.toml` and `config.toml` files.

## `config.toml`

The various parts of the `config.toml` configuration file:
