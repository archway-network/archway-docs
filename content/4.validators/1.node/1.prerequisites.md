## Hardware requirements:

The following hardware requirements are expected:
- Linux distribution
- x86_64 processor
- 16 GB RAM
- 500 GB to 2 TB storage\*
- Storage size for validators depends on the level of desired pruning.

## Installing Prerequisites

Below are the packages that your machine needs to complete the installation process.
::highlight-card

```bash
# updates and upgrades the list of local packages
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt upgrade -y

#installs docker, build-essential package and git
sudo apt-get install build-essential docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin git

```

## Installing Go

Go Version 1.16 or higher is required to run an Archway node. Please find a [guide here](https://golang.org/doc/install) on how to install Go.

Ensure the Go environment variables are [set properly](https://golang.org/doc/gopath_code#GOPATH) on your system.

As an example, you may need to install Go by running:

```sudo apt install go```

and set up the `GOPATH` by launching:

```bash
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin:$GOPATH/bin
```

or:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
```

and applying those changes with:

```bash
source ~/.profile
```

## Docker (optional)

You can also install **archwayd** by using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker 'Install Docker').

For Linux users, it's recommended to run the Docker daemon in [Rootless Mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/ 'Docker Rootless mode').
