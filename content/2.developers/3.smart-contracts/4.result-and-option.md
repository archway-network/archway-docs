# Understanding `Result` and `Option`

In Rust, **Result** and **Option** are powerful enum types used to handle success, failure, and optional values in a type-safe manner. These types are essential when developing smart contracts in CosmWasm, as they help manage various outcomes in contract logic.

## Result

The `Result` type is an enum that represents either success (`Ok`) or failure (`Err`). It is commonly used in functions that can return errors, such as contract entry points and handlers.

### Definition

```rust
enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),   // Represents success and contains a value of type T
    Err(E),  // Represents failure and contains an error of type E
}
```

### Usage in contracts

In CosmWasm, contract entry points and handlers often return `Result<Response, ContractError>`. This type signifies that the function can either succeed and return a `Response` or fail and return a `ContractError`.

#### Example: handling a transfer in a CW20 contract

Let's look at how `Result` is used in the `execute_transfer` function from a [CW20](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus/blob/main/packages/cw20/README.md) contract:

```rust
pub fn execute_transfer(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    info: MessageInfo,
    recipient: String,
    amount: Uint128,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    if amount.is_zero() {
        return Err(ContractError::InvalidZeroAmount {});
    }

    let rcpt_addr = deps.api.addr_validate(&recipient)?;

    BALANCES.update(
        deps.storage,
        &info.sender,
        |balance: Option<Uint128>| -> StdResult<_> {
            Ok(balance.unwrap_or_default().checked_sub(amount)?)
        },
    )?;
    BALANCES.update(
        deps.storage,
        &rcpt_addr,
        |balance: Option<Uint128>| -> StdResult<_> {
            Ok(balance.unwrap_or_default() + amount)
        },
    )?;

    let res = Response::new()
        .add_attribute("action", "transfer")
        .add_attribute("from", info.sender)
        .add_attribute("to", recipient)
        .add_attribute("amount", amount);
    Ok(res)
}
```

### Key Points

- **Ok(T)**: Represents a successful operation, returning a value of type `T` (in this case, a `Response`).
- **Err(E)**: Represents a failed operation, returning an error of type `E` (in this case, a `ContractError`).

The function uses `Result` to ensure that any errors in the process (such as invalid addresses or insufficient balances) are handled gracefully.

## StdResult

`StdResult` is a type alias commonly used in CosmWasm. It is defined as:

```rust
type StdResult<T> = Result<T, StdError>;
```

`StdResult` is frequently used in query handlers and other functions where the error type is a standard `StdError` rather than a custom `ContractError`.

### Example: using `StdResult` in a query handler

In the [nameservice](https://github.com/deus-labs/cw-contracts/tree/main/contracts/nameservice) contract, the `query` function returns a `StdResult<Binary>`:

```rust
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn query(deps: Deps, env: Env, msg: QueryMsg) -> StdResult<Binary> {
    match msg {
        QueryMsg::ResolveRecord { name } => query_resolver(deps, env, name),
        QueryMsg::Config {} => to_binary(&config_read(deps.storage).load()?),
    }
}
```

### Implementation of `query_resolver`:

```rust
fn query_resolver(deps: Deps, _env: Env, name: String) -> StdResult<Binary> {
    let key = name.as_bytes();

    let address = match resolver_read(deps.storage).may_load(key)? {
        Some(record) => Some(String::from(&record.owner)),
        None => None,
    };
    let resp = ResolveRecordResponse { address };

    to_binary(&resp)
}
```

### Key points

- **StdResult<T>**: A convenient alias for `Result<T, StdError>`, simplifying error handling in common scenarios.
- **Pattern Matching**: The `match` statement is used to handle the `Result` and `Option` types, making the code more readable and safe.

## Option

The `Option` type in Rust represents the possibility of a value being either present (`Some`) or absent (`None`). Unlike many other programming languages that use `null` or `nil`, Rust explicitly handles optional values with the `Option` enum.

### Definition:=

```rust
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T),  // Contains a value of type T
    None,     // Represents the absence of a value
}
```

### Usage in contracts:

`Option` is often used in smart contracts to handle optional parameters or states that may not always have a value.

#### Example: handling optional prices

Consider a contract that allows optional `purchase_price` and `transfer_price` values:

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
pub struct InstantiateMsg {
    pub purchase_price: Option<Coin>,
    pub transfer_price: Option<Coin>,
}
```

### Handling `Option` with `match`

To work with `Option` values, you typically use the `match` statement:

```rust
let address = match resolver_read(deps.storage).may_load(key)? {
    Some(record) => Some(String::from(&record.owner)),
    None => None,
};
```

### Key Points

- **Some(T)**: Wraps an inner value of type `T`, which can be accessed using `.unwrap()` or safely handled using pattern matching.
- **None**: Represents the absence of a value and is often used as a default or placeholder when a value is not present.

### Best practices for handling `None`

If returning `None` would indicate an error, it’s generally better to handle the error explicitly rather than letting it propagate silently. This can prevent unexpected behavior and make your code more robust.

## Practical tips for developers

1. **Use `Result` for Error Handling**: When writing smart contracts, always use `Result` to handle potential errors. This ensures that errors are caught and handled gracefully, improving the reliability of your contract.
  
2. **Leverage `StdResult` in Queries**: For standard queries, use `StdResult` to simplify your error handling and make your code more consistent with CosmWasm conventions.

3. **Handle `Option` Safely**: Avoid using `.unwrap()` on `Option` unless you are certain that the value exists. Instead, use pattern matching to handle both `Some` and `None` cases.

4. **Pattern Matching**: Use Rust’s powerful pattern matching to work with `Result` and `Option` types. This makes your code clearer and safer.

5. **Error Propagation with `?`**: Use the `?` operator to propagate errors up the call stack. This keeps your code clean and makes error handling more straightforward.
