# Managing complex state and maps

In more advanced smart contract solutions, you may need to store and manage complex data structures. While simple key-value pairs might suffice for basic applications, more complex use cases often require storing extensive data, such as user balances, configurations, or multi-dimensional data sets.

This guide will walk you through managing complex state using `maps` and `indexed maps` in CosmWasm, using the example of tracking CW20 token balances and more advanced use cases.

## Storing data with maps

Maps in CosmWasm allow you to associate keys with values, providing a flexible way to manage structured data. For instance, in a CW20 token contract, you can track token balances by associating addresses with their respective balances using a **Map** data structure.

Here’s how you define a **Map** in the **state.rs** file to store balances:

```rust
use cw_storage_plus::Map;
use cosmwasm_std::{Addr, Uint128};

pub const BALANCES: Map<&Addr, Uint128> = Map::new("balance");
```

### Key points

- **Map**: This is a generic type provided by the `cw-storage-plus` crate that allows you to store key-value pairs. The key is an address (`&Addr`), and the value is the balance (`Uint128`).
- **"balance"**: This is the storage key prefix for the map. Each entry in the map will be stored under this prefix, allowing for efficient retrieval and management of balances.

## Interacting with maps

To effectively manage the data stored in a **Map**, you need to understand how to read, update, and remove entries. Below is an example of how to update a user’s balance after a token transfer, using the **BALANCES** map.

### Example: updating a balance

Here’s a snippet from the CW20 base contract that demonstrates how to interact with the **BALANCES** map:

```rust
let rcpt_addr = deps.api.addr_validate(&recipient)?;
BALANCES.update(
    deps.storage,
    &info.sender,
    |balance: Option<Uint128>| -> StdResult<_> {
        Ok(balance.unwrap_or_default().checked_sub(amount)?)
    },
)?;
```

### Breaking down the code:

1. **Address Validation**: 
   - `deps.api.addr_validate(&recipient)?` ensures that the recipient's address is valid. If it isn’t, the function returns an error, preventing further execution.
   - **rcpt_addr** is the validated recipient address, which acts as the key in the map.

2. **Updating the Balance**: 
   - **deps.storage**: The storage interface is passed in, which allows access to the contract's persistent state.
   - **BALANCES.update**: The `update` method is called on the **BALANCES** map. This method allows you to modify the value associated with a specific key (in this case, the sender's address).
   - **Anonymous Function (Lambda)**: The update function takes a closure (anonymous function) that receives the current balance (if any) and returns a new balance. 
   - **balance.unwrap_or_default()**: If the balance doesn’t exist (i.e., the key is not found), it defaults to zero.
   - **checked_sub(amount)**: Safely subtracts the specified amount from the balance. If the subtraction would result in a negative balance, it returns an error.

3. **Error Handling**: 
   - The `?` operator is used throughout the code to handle errors. If any operation fails (e.g., if the balance is insufficient), the function returns an error, and the transaction is rolled back.

## Reading data from maps

To retrieve a user’s balance from the **BALANCES** map, you can use the `load` method:

```rust
let balance = BALANCES.load(deps.storage, &rcpt_addr)?;
```

### Explanation

- **BALANCES.load**: Retrieves the value (balance) associated with the given address (`rcpt_addr`). If the address has no balance recorded, it will return an error.
- **Error Handling**: Ensure you handle potential errors, such as when an address does not have a balance entry.

## Advanced usage: indexed maps

For more complex queries and operations, such as retrieving data based on multiple criteria or filtering results, you can use `IndexedMap`. This data structure is particularly useful when you need to query the state efficiently based on secondary keys or indices.

### What is `IndexedMap`?

`IndexedMap` is a powerful extension of `Map` that allows you to define multiple indices over your data. This enables efficient querying and sorting based on these indices.

### Example: using IndexedMap

Imagine you want to store and retrieve user balances along with additional metadata, such as the user's registration time and account status. Here's how you could define such a state structure using `IndexedMap`:

```rust
use cw_storage_plus::{IndexedMap, IndexList, MultiIndex};
use cosmwasm_std::{Addr, Uint128};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, PartialEq, JsonSchema, Debug)]
pub struct UserInfo {
    pub balance: Uint128,
    pub registered_at: u64,
    pub is_active: bool,
}

// Define indices for the indexed map
pub struct UserIndexes<'a> {
    pub balance: MultiIndex<'a, Uint128, UserInfo, Addr>,
    pub registered_at: MultiIndex<'a, u64, UserInfo, Addr>,
}

impl<'a> IndexList<UserInfo> for UserIndexes<'a> {
    fn get_indexes(&'_ self) -> Box<dyn Iterator<Item = &'_ dyn MultiIndex<UserInfo>> + '_> {
        let v: Vec<&dyn MultiIndex<UserInfo>> = vec![&self.balance, &self.registered_at];
        Box::new(v.into_iter())
    }
}

// Initialize the indexed map
pub const USERS: IndexedMap<&Addr, UserInfo, UserIndexes> = IndexedMap::new(
    "users",
    UserIndexes {
        balance: MultiIndex::new(
            |d| d.balance,
            "users",
            "users__balance",
        ),
        registered_at: MultiIndex::new(
            |d| d.registered_at,
            "users",
            "users__registered_at",
        ),
    },
);
```

### Explanation

- **IndexedMap**: This data structure allows you to create a map with secondary indices, enabling efficient queries based on those indices.
- **UserInfo**: A struct that contains information about the user, including their balance, registration time, and active status.
- **UserIndexes**: This struct defines the indices for the `IndexedMap`. Each `MultiIndex` corresponds to a field in `UserInfo` that you want to index by.
- **MultiIndex**: This type allows you to create an index on a specific field within your data structure. For example, you can index users by their balance or registration time.

### Querying with IndexedMap

With `IndexedMap`, you can perform efficient queries based on the defined indices. For example, you can retrieve all users registered after a certain date:

```rust
let registered_since = 1609459200; // Example timestamp
let query = USERS
    .idx
    .registered_at
    .range(deps.storage, Some(registered_since), None, cosmwasm_std::Order::Ascending)?
    .collect::<StdResult<Vec<_>>>()?;
```

### Key Points

- **Range Queries**: The `range` method allows you to query entries within a specified range, such as all users registered after a certain date.
- **Order**: You can specify the order of the results, such as ascending or descending.

## Practical tips for developers

1. **Use IndexedMap for Advanced Queries**: When you need to perform complex queries or filter data based on multiple criteria, consider using `IndexedMap`. It provides efficient indexing and querying capabilities.

2. **Design Efficient Indices**: Think carefully about the indices you define in `IndexedMap`. The right indices can significantly improve the performance of your contract, especially when dealing with large datasets.

3. **Modularize Your State Logic**: Keep your state management logic organized and modular. For instance, separate your map and indexed map definitions into a dedicated `state.rs` file.

4. **Error Handling**: Always handle potential errors when interacting with state, especially when performing updates or queries. This ensures your contract remains robust and reliable.
