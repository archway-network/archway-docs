# Complex state and maps

In more complex solutions, it may be necessary to store additional information. One option is to serialize extensive JSON data structures, allowing data retrieval through key-value pairs. In the context of CW20, associating addresses with their CW20 balances is achieved using a **Map** data structure:

```rust
pub const BALANCES: Map<&Addr, Uint128> = Map::new("balance");
```

The code for this can be found <a href="https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus/blob/main/contracts/cw20-base/src/state.rs#L35" target="_blank">here</a>.

The following presents an example of interacting with the BALANCES map value, as seen <a href="https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus/blob/main/contracts/cw20-base/src/contract.rs#L250-L258" target="_blank">here</a>. The relevant code snippet is:

```rust
let rcpt_addr = deps.api.addr_validate(&recipient)?;
BALANCES.update(
   deps.storage,
   &info.sender,
   |balance: Option<Uint128>| -> StdResult<_> {
      Ok(balance.unwrap_or_default().checked_sub(amount)?)
   },
)?;
```

There's a lot happening here, so let's break it down:

1. **deps.storage** is provided as an input. This is from the contract context. **deps** is similar to **ctx** you may have encountered in the Cosmos SDK.
2. **&rcpt_addr** is a borrowed reference to the validated recipient address. It has been verified and is valid, or else the **let** statement would have raised an error. This represents the key in the key/value pair.
3. The third statement is an anonymous function (lambda) that returns **StdResult** and performs some computation based on the current value of **balance**. **balance** represents the value in the key/value pair, and **&rcpt_addr** is the key.
