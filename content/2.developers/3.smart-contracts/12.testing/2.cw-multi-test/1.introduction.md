# MultiTest

**`MultiTest`** is a testing tool designed to facilitate multi-contract interactions within the
CosmWasm ecosystem. Its primary focus is on providing developers with a robust framework for
off-chain testing of complex smart contract interactions and operations involving various Cosmos
modules.

  **`MultiTest`** is a blockchain **SIMULATOR**, allowing tested smart contracts to interact as if
  they were operating on a real blockchain.

The most valuable advantages of using **`MultiTest`** is that it allows for testing and debugging
smart contracts with access to the Rust source code and eliminates the need to run a complete
blockchain node to begin designing the functionality of the contract. Additionally, **`MultiTest`**
enables the execution of tests significantly faster than on a real blockchain, as it bypasses the
overhead associated with network consensus and block production. This results in a more efficient
development cycle, allowing for quicker iterations and faster identification of issues, even before
the smart contract is deployed on the blockchain.

While **`MultiTest`** is a blockchain **SIMULATOR**, it may happen, that the behavior of the real
blockchain might slightly differ in some edge cases.
