# Installation

**`MultiTest`** is as a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) library named [cw-multi-test](https://crates.io/crates/cw-multi-test), and is hosted on [crates.io](https://crates.io).

## Usage

To use **`MultiTest`** in your project, simply add it as a **development dependency** to
**Cargo.toml** file:

```toml filename="Cargo.toml" copy
[dev-dependencies]
cw-multi-test = "2"
```

<br />

::alert{variant="info"}
  **`MultiTest`** is a **TESTING** library and should **ALWAYS** be added to your project as a
  **DEVELOPMENT DEPENDENCY** in section **`[dev-dependencies]`** of the **Cargo.toml** file.

  **`MultiTest`** **IS NOT** designed to be used in production code on a real-life blockchain.

## Prerequisities

### Rust and Cargo

The only prerequisite to test smart contracts using **`MultiTest`** is having [Rust and Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed.

::alert{variant="info"}
  We recommend installing Rust using the official [rustup installer](https://rustup.rs). This makes it easy to stay on
  the most recent version of Rust and Cargo.

### Tarpaulin and cargo-nextest

Optionally, you may want to install [Tarpaulin](https://github.com/xd009642/tarpaulin) for measuring code coverage, and [cargo-nextest](https://nexte.st) for running tests faster with a clean and beautiful user interface.

Installing **Tarpaulin**:

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
cargo install cargo-tarpaulin
```

Installing **cargo-nextest**:

```shell copy filename="TERMINAL"
cargo install cargo-nextest
```
