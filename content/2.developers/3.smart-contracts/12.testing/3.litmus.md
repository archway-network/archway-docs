### Litmus - Gas estimation & performance testing

**Litmus** is a powerful testing tool designed to assist developers in optimizing gas usage and testing the performance of smart contracts on the Archway network. It consists of two key projects:

1. **Archway Test Tube**: A wrapper for the Archway blockchain that allows native Rust tests for smart contracts without needing to spin up a full node. It offers real-chain functionality, supporting features like rewards and callbacks.
  
2. **Ecometer**: A performance testing wrapper for Archway Test Tube that benchmarks transactions and generates gas consumption graphs to help you monitor and optimize your contract's gas efficiency.

For more information on how to use Litmus in your development workflow, including setup instructions and detailed use cases, visit the [Litmus Documentation](/developers/developer-tools/litmus).
