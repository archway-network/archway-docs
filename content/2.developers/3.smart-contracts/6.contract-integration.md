# Integrate with smart contracts

Integrating with other CosmWasm contracts involves understanding and utilizing entry points effectively. Entry points in a smart contract are the methods through which external actors can interact with the contract. See more details [here](/developers/smart-contracts/entry-points).

In CosmWasm, inter-contract calls are facilitated using the **CosmosMsg::Wasm(WasmMsg::Execute{})** message type. This allows your contract to send messages to other contracts during execution, enabling complex interactions and integrations. Additionally, you can use **SubMsg** for more advanced control over inter-contract calls, including handling responses from the called contracts. See the [following](/developers/smart-contracts/message/submessages) for more details on the use of submessages.

## Structure of **WasmMsg::Execute**

The **WasmMsg::Execute** type requires the following arguments:

- **contract_addr**: The address of the target contract.
- **msg**: The message to be sent to the target contract, formatted as a JSON object that conforms to the target contract’s schema.
- **funds**: (Optional) The coins to be transferred to the target contract as part of the call.

## Example: making calls to a CW20 contract

In this example, we demonstrate how to interact with a **CW20** contract, specifically calling its `Transfer` method. CW20 is a standard for fungible tokens in the CosmWasm ecosystem, similar to ERC-20 on Ethereum. For more details on the CW20 contract, including its available methods and message schemas, you can refer to the [CW20 Core Contract Documentation](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus/tree/main/contracts/cw20-base).

### Using `WasmMsg::Execute`

Below is an example of how to use **CosmosMsg::Wasm(WasmMsg::Execute{})** to interact with a CW20 contract’s `execute` method:

```rust
// Step 1: Define the Transfer message for the CW20 contract
let transfer_msg = to_binary(&Transfer {
    recipient: deps.api.addr_humanize(&recipient_raw)?,
    amount, // The amount of tokens to transfer
})?;

// Step 2: Construct the WasmMsg::Execute message
let msg = WasmMsg::Execute {
    contract_addr: other_contract_addr.to_string(), // Address of the CW20 contract
    msg: transfer_msg, // The message to send, encoded in binary format
    funds: vec![], // Optional funds to transfer alongside the message, left empty here
};

// Step 3: Create a response that includes the message to be executed
Ok(Response::new()
    .add_attribute("action", "call_cw20_transfer") // Add custom attributes for logging
    .add_message(msg)) // Add the constructed message to the response
```

**Explanation**:

1. **Step 1: Define the Transfer Message**

   The `transfer_msg` is created by encoding a `Transfer` struct into a binary format that the target contract can understand. The `recipient` field is obtained by converting a raw address into a human-readable format, and `amount` represents the tokens to be transferred. The use of `to_binary` ensures that the message is properly formatted according to the target contract’s expectations.

2. **Step 2: Construct the `WasmMsg::Execute` Message**

   The `WasmMsg::Execute` struct is created to encapsulate the inter-contract call. The `contract_addr` specifies the address of the contract you want to interact with. The `msg` field contains the binary-encoded transfer message, which is sent to the target contract. The `funds` field allows you to send native tokens (like ATOM or ARCH) with the message, but in this case, it’s an empty vector, meaning no funds are transferred.

3. **Step 3: Create the Response**

   The `Response::new()` function is used to construct the response that your contract will return after executing the logic. The response includes attributes (key-value pairs) that can be used for logging or analytics. The `.add_message(msg)` method appends the previously constructed `WasmMsg::Execute` message to the response. This ensures that after your contract's execution, the message will be dispatched to the target contract for execution.

### Using `SubMsg` for enhanced control

**SubMsg** is an advanced feature in CosmWasm that allows you to send messages to other contracts and handle their responses. This is particularly useful when you need to ensure that certain actions are only performed if the inter-contract call is successful, or when you want to handle failures differently.

Below is an example of how to use **SubMsg** with the same CW20 contract’s `Transfer` method:

```rust
use cosmwasm_std::{to_binary, Response, SubMsg, WasmMsg};

// Define a unique ID for the submessage reply
const CW20_TRANSFER_REPLY_ID: u64 = 1u64;

// Step 1: Define the Transfer message for the CW20 contract
let transfer_msg = to_binary(&Transfer {
    recipient: deps.api.addr_humanize(&recipient_raw)?,
    amount, // The amount of tokens to transfer
})?;

// Step 2: Construct the WasmMsg::Execute message
let msg = WasmMsg::Execute {
    contract_addr: other_contract_addr.to_string(), // Address of the CW20 contract
    msg: transfer_msg, // The message to send, encoded in binary format
    funds: vec![], // Optional funds to transfer alongside the message, left empty here
};

// Step 3: Wrap the message in a SubMsg for enhanced control
let sub_msg = SubMsg::reply_on_success(msg, CW20_TRANSFER_REPLY_ID);

// Step 4: Create a response that includes the SubMsg to be executed
Ok(Response::new()
    .add_attribute("action", "call_cw20_transfer_submsg") // Add custom attributes for logging
    .add_submessage(sub_msg)) // Add the SubMsg to the response
```

**Explanation**:

1. **Step 1: Define the Transfer Message**  
   The `transfer_msg` is created by encoding a `Transfer` struct into a binary format that the target contract can understand. The `recipient` field is obtained by converting a raw address into a human-readable format, and `amount` represents the tokens to be transferred. The use of `to_binary` ensures that the message is properly formatted according to the target contract’s expectations.

2. **Step 2: Construct the `WasmMsg::Execute` Message**  
   The `WasmMsg::Execute` struct is created to encapsulate the inter-contract call. The `contract_addr` specifies the address of the CW20 contract you want to interact with. The `msg` field contains the binary-encoded transfer message, which is sent to the target contract. The `funds` field is optional and can be used to transfer native tokens along with the message, but it’s left empty here.

3. **Step 3: Wrap the Message in a SubMsg**  
   The `SubMsg::reply_on_success` function is used to wrap the `WasmMsg::Execute` message in a `SubMsg`. This ensures that a reply will be sent back to the contract only if the message execution is successful. The `CW20_TRANSFER_REPLY_ID` is a unique identifier that helps distinguish this reply from others.

4. **Step 4: Create the Response**  
   The `Response::new()` function is used to create a response that includes the `SubMsg`. The `.add_submessage(sub_msg)` method appends the `SubMsg` to the response. When this response is returned, the CW20 `Transfer` will be executed, and the contract will receive a reply if it succeeds.

#### Handling the reply from the SubMsg

To handle the reply from a `SubMsg`, you must implement a reply handler in your contract:

```rust
use cosmwasm_std::{DepsMut, Env, Reply, Response, StdError, StdResult};

#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn reply(deps: DepsMut, _env: Env, msg: Reply) -> StdResult<Response> {
    match msg.id {
        CW20_TRANSFER_REPLY_ID => handle_transfer_reply(deps, msg),
        _ => Err(StdError::generic_err("Unknown reply id")),
    }
}

fn handle_transfer_reply(deps: DepsMut, msg: Reply) -> StdResult<Response> {
    // Check if the transfer was successful
    if msg.result.is_err() {
        return Err(StdError::generic_err("CW20 transfer failed"));
    }

    // Process the success (e.g., update state or emit an event)
    Ok(Response::new().add_attribute("action", "transfer_success"))
}
```

1. **Reply Entry Point**  
   The `reply` function is marked as an entry point for handling submessage replies. It matches the `msg.id` against the `CW20_TRANSFER_REPLY_ID` to determine which reply handler to call.

2. **Handling the Transfer Reply**  
   The `handle_transfer_reply` function checks if the transfer was successful. If it failed, it returns an error; otherwise, it proceeds to process the success, such as updating the contract state or emitting an event.

## Advanced integration techniques

When interacting with other contracts, consider the following best practices:

- **Check Contract Interfaces**: Always review the target contract’s message schemas and entry points. Contracts may have different versions or upgrades, so ensuring compatibility is critical.
  
- **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Ensure that your contract properly handles errors that may arise from inter-contract calls. This might include setting up retries or fallbacks in case of failed calls.
  
- **Security Considerations**: Validate all input data and avoid exposing sensitive contract states through queries. Implement proper access controls on critical execute functions.

## Execution flow and failure handling

It’s important to remember that **WasmMsg::Execute** messages are only executed after your contract’s execution completes successfully. If your contract’s execution fails, the **WasmMsg::Execute** message will not be sent, ensuring atomicity in transaction execution.
