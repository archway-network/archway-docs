# Sudo execution

Sudo execution is a privileged smart contract entry point that can only be invoked by trusted native Cosmos modules. It cannot be called by users or other smart contracts. This functionality is particularly useful for enforcing governance proposals, system-level operations, and other actions that require elevated permissions. A contract must be instantiated before it can respond to `sudo` messages from governance or other native modules.

This is used within Archway's [Callback](/developers/guides/callback/introduction), [CW-ICA](/developers/guides/cw-ica/introduction), [CW-Fees](/developers/guides/cw-fees/introduction) and [CW-Errors](/developers/guides/cw-errors/introduction) modules.

## Understanding SudoMsg

The `SudoMsg` enum defines the different types of privileged messages that can be sent to a contract via the `sudo` entry point. These messages are only exposed to internal Cosmos SDK modules, ensuring that only trusted (native/Go) code in the blockchain can execute them.

### Example SudoMsg

```rust
/// SudoMsg is only exposed for internal Cosmos SDK modules to call.
/// This is showing how we can expose "admin" functionality that cannot be called by
/// external users or contracts, but only trusted (native/Go) code in the blockchain
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub enum SudoMsg {
    MoveFunds {
        recipient: String,
        amount: Vec<Coin>,
    },
}
```

### Example sudo entry point

```rust
#[entry_point]
pub fn sudo(_deps: DepsMut, _env: Env, msg: SudoMsg) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    match msg {
        SudoMsg::MoveFunds { recipient, amount } => {
            let msg = BankMsg::Send {
                to_address: recipient,
                amount,
            };
            Ok(Response::new().add_message(msg))
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:
- **SudoMsg::MoveFunds**: This variant of `SudoMsg` allows the contract to move funds from the contract's balance to a specified recipient. The `amount` is a vector of `Coin`, representing the funds to be transferred.
- **sudo entry point**: The `sudo` function processes incoming `SudoMsg` messages. If the message is `MoveFunds`, it creates a `BankMsg::Send` message to transfer the funds and returns it in a `Response`.

## Testing sudo execution

Testing sudo functionality follows the same principles as testing other contract entry points, with the key difference that `sudo` can only be triggered by native modules, not directly by users.

When using **cw-multi-test** for integration testing, you'll need to add an additional call to the contract wrapper to support `sudo` testing:

### Example: contract wrapper with sudo

```rust
pub fn contract_template() -> Box<dyn Contract<Empty>> {
    let contract = ContractWrapper::new(
        crate::contract::execute,
        crate::contract::instantiate,
        crate::contract::query,
    );
    let contract_with_sudo = contract.with_sudo(crate::contract::sudo);
    Box::new(contract_with_sudo)
}
```

#### Explanation

1. **ContractWrapper::new**: This initializes the contract wrapper with the contract's `execute`, `instantiate`, and `query` functions.
2. **with_sudo**: This method is called on the contract wrapper to add support for the `sudo` entry point, enabling it to handle `SudoMsg` during tests.

### Testing sudo messages

Here is an example of how you might test the `sudo` functionality using **cw-multi-test**:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_sudo_move_funds() {
    let mut app = mock_app();
    let contract_id = app.store_code(contract_template());
    let owner = Addr::unchecked("owner");
    let recipient = Addr::unchecked("recipient");

    // Instantiate the contract
    let contract_addr = app
        .instantiate_contract(contract_id, owner.clone(), &InstantiateMsg {}, &[], "Test contract", None)
        .unwrap();

    // Prepare a sudo message to move funds
    let sudo_msg = SudoMsg::MoveFunds {
        recipient: recipient.to_string(),
        amount: vec![coin(1000, "uusd")],
    };

    // Execute the sudo message
    let res = app.sudo(contract_addr.clone(), &sudo_msg);
    assert!(res.is_ok());

    // Verify the funds were moved
    let recipient_balance = app.wrap().query_balance(recipient, "uusd").unwrap();
    assert_eq!(recipient_balance.amount, Uint128::new(1000));
}
```

#### Explanation

- **mock_app**: Initializes a simulated blockchain environment.
- **app.store_code**: Stores the contract code in the simulated environment.
- **app.instantiate_contract**: Instantiates the contract.
- **SudoMsg::MoveFunds**: Prepares a `sudo` message to move funds.
- **app.sudo**: Executes the `sudo` message as if it were sent by a trusted module.
- **app.wrap().query_balance**: Queries the recipient's balance to verify that the funds were moved.

## Best practices for sudo execution

- **Restrict Sudo Usage**: Ensure that `sudo` is only used for operations that require elevated permissions and should not be exposed to external users or contracts.
- **Test Thoroughly**: Thoroughly test all `sudo` functionality to ensure that privileged operations behave as expected and do not introduce vulnerabilities.
- **Documentation**: Clearly document the `sudo` functionality in your contract to help other developers understand its purpose and usage.

By understanding and properly implementing `sudo` functionality, you can create more secure and robust CosmWasm contracts that can integrate with the broader Cosmos ecosystem in a trusted manner.
