# Submessages

In CosmWasm, messages are used to interact with both SDK modules and CosmWasm smart contracts. Typically, these messages are executed in a "**set-and-forget**" manner, meaning you won't receive any direct response indicating whether the call was successful or not. However, there are scenarios where it is crucial to know the outcome of a call:

- **Instantiating a new contract and obtaining the contract address**
- **Executing an action and verifying that it succeeded (e.g., ensuring that a token transfer to your contract was successful)**
- **Handling errors from cross-contract calls instead of rolling back the entire transaction**

To achieve this, you can use **submessages**, which allow you to receive the result of the message sent from your smart contract. For more detailed information on submessage semantics and execution order, you can refer to the [CosmWasm Semantics documentation](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/blob/main/SEMANTICS.md#submessages).

## Creating a submessage

A submessage wraps a `CosmosMsg` in a `SubMsg` struct, which includes additional details such as a unique identifier, gas limit, and reply strategy.

```rust
pub struct SubMsg<T> {
    pub id: u64,                // Unique ID to handle the reply
    pub msg: CosmosMsg<T>,      // The message to be sent
    pub gas_limit: Option<u64>, // Optional gas limit for the submessage
    pub reply_on: ReplyOn,      // Defines when a reply should be triggered
}
```

You can find the source code for the **SubMsg** struct [here](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/blob/main/packages/std/src/results/submessages.rs).

### Example: instantiating a CW20 token using a submessage

Below is an example of how to create a new CW20 token using a submessage and handle the reply to get the contract address.

```rust
use cosmwasm_std::{to_binary, Response, SubMsg, WasmMsg};
use cw20::MinterResponse;

const INSTANTIATE_REPLY_ID: u64 = 1u64;

// Create a message to instantiate a new CW20 token
let instantiate_msg = WasmMsg::Instantiate {
    admin: Some(env.contract.address.to_string()),
    code_id: msg.cw20_code_id,
    msg: to_binary(&cw20_base::msg::InstantiateMsg {
        name: "New Token".to_string(),
        symbol: "NTKN".to_string(),
        decimals: 6,
        initial_balances: vec![],
        mint: Some(MinterResponse {
            minter: env.contract.address.to_string(),
            cap: None,
        }),
    })?,
    funds: vec![],
    label: "New CW20 Token".to_string(),
};

// Create a submessage that wraps the message above
let submessage = SubMsg::reply_on_success(instantiate_msg, INSTANTIATE_REPLY_ID);

// Create a response with the submessage
let response = Response::new().add_submessage(submessage);
```

1. Imports:
   ```rust
   use cosmwasm_std::{to_binary, Response, SubMsg, WasmMsg};
   use cw20::MinterResponse;
   ```
   These lines import necessary types from the `cosmwasm_std` and `cw20` crates.

2. Constant Definition:
   ```rust
   const INSTANTIATE_REPLY_ID: u64 = 1u64;
   ```
   This defines a constant ID that will be used to identify the reply from this specific instantiation.

3. Creating the Instantiate Message:
   ```rust
   let instantiate_msg = WasmMsg::Instantiate { ... };
   ```
   This creates a `WasmMsg::Instantiate` struct, which is used to instantiate a new contract. Let's break down its fields:

   - `admin: Some(env.contract.address.to_string())`: Sets the admin of the new contract to the current contract's address.
   - `code_id: msg.cw20_code_id`: Uses the CW20 code ID provided in the incoming message.
   - `msg: to_binary(&cw20_base::msg::InstantiateMsg { ... })?`: This is the instantiation message for the CW20 token:
     - `name: "New Token".to_string()`: Sets the token name.
     - `symbol: "NTKN".to_string()`: Sets the token symbol.
     - `decimals: 6`: Sets the number of decimal places for the token.
     - `initial_balances: vec![]`: Initializes with no initial balances.
     - `mint: Some(MinterResponse { ... })`: Sets up minting capabilities:
       - `minter: env.contract.address.to_string()`: The current contract can mint tokens.
       - `cap: None`: No cap on the total supply.
   - `funds: vec![]`: No funds are sent with this instantiation.
   - `label: "New CW20 Token".to_string()`: A label for the new contract.

4. Creating a Submessage:
   ```rust
   let submessage = SubMsg::reply_on_success(instantiate_msg, INSTANTIATE_REPLY_ID);
   ```
   This wraps the instantiate message in a `SubMsg`. The `reply_on_success` function means that a reply will be sent back to this contract only if the instantiation is successful.

5. Creating the Response:
   ```rust
   let response = Response::new().add_submessage(submessage);
   ```
   This creates a new `Response` and adds the submessage to it. When this response is returned from the contract, it will trigger the instantiation of the new CW20 token contract.

## Reply strategies

Submessages offer different reply options that determine when a callback to the contract should occur:

```rust
pub enum ReplyOn {
    /// Always perform a callback after SubMsg is processed
    Always,
    /// Only callback if SubMsg returned an error, no callback on success
    Error,
    /// Only callback if SubMsg was successful, no callback on error
    Success,
    /// Never make a callback (default behavior similar to CosmosMsg)
    Never,
}
```

In the previous example, we used the **SubMsg::reply_on_success** shorthand to create a submessage that triggers a reply only on success. You can also explicitly specify the reply strategy when creating a submessage:

```rust
let submessage = SubMsg {
    gas_limit: None,
    id: INSTANTIATE_REPLY_ID,
    reply_on: ReplyOn::Success,
    msg: instantiate_tx.into(),
};
```

## Handling a reply

To handle the reply from a submessage, the calling contract must implement a new entry point. This entry point processes the reply based on the unique ID assigned to the submessage.

### Example: handling a reply for contract instantiation

```rust
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn reply(deps: DepsMut, _env: Env, msg: Reply) -> StdResult<Response> {
    match msg.id {
        INSTANTIATE_REPLY_ID => handle_instantiate_reply(deps, msg),
        id => Err(StdError::generic_err(format!("Unknown reply id: {}", id))),
    }
}

fn handle_instantiate_reply(deps: DepsMut, msg: Reply) -> StdResult<Response> {
    // Parse and handle the reply data, saving the contract address
    let res = parse_reply_instantiate_data(msg)?;

    // Save res.contract_address or perform other actions
    Ok(Response::new())
}
```

1. Entry Point Attribute:
   ```rust
   #[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
   ```
   This attribute marks the `reply` function as an entry point for the CosmWasm contract, but only when the "library" feature is not enabled. This allows the same code to be used both as a standalone contract and as a library.

2. Reply Function Signature:
   ```rust
   pub fn reply(deps: DepsMut, _env: Env, msg: Reply) -> StdResult<Response>
   ```
   - `deps: DepsMut`: Mutable dependencies, allowing the function to modify contract state.
   - `_env: Env`: Environment variables (unused in this example, hence the underscore).
   - `msg: Reply`: The reply message received from a submessage.
   - Returns a `StdResult<Response>`, which is either a successful `Response` or an error.

3. Match Statement:
   ```rust
   match msg.id {
     INSTANTIATE_REPLY_ID => handle_instantiate_reply(deps, msg),
     id => Err(StdError::generic_err(format!("Unknown reply id: {}", id))),
   }
   ```
   This matches on the `id` of the reply message:
   - If it matches `INSTANTIATE_REPLY_ID`, it calls `handle_instantiate_reply`.
   - For any other id, it returns an error with a message about an unknown reply id.

4. Handle Instantiate Reply Function:
   ```rust
   fn handle_instantiate_reply(deps: DepsMut, msg: Reply) -> StdResult<Response>
   ```
   This function specifically handles replies from contract instantiation.

5. Parsing Reply Data:
   ```rust
   let res = parse_reply_instantiate_data(msg)?;
   ```
   This line parses the reply data. The `?` operator will return early if an error occurs during parsing.

6. Handling the Result:
   ```rust
   // Save res.contract_address or perform other actions
   Ok(Response::new())
   ```
   This is where you would typically save the new contract's address or perform other actions based on the instantiation result. The function returns an empty `Response` object, which you might want to modify to include relevant data or events.



### Example: handling a reply from a token transfer

```rust
use cosmwasm_std::{DepsMut, Event, Reply, Response, StdError, StdResult};

const CW20_TRANSFER_REPLY_ID: u64 = 1u64;

#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn reply(deps: DepsMut, _env: Env, msg: Reply) -> StdResult<Response> {
    match msg.id {
        CW20_TRANSFER_REPLY_ID => handle_transfer_reply(deps, msg),
        id => Err(StdError::generic_err(format!("Unknown reply id: {}", id))),
    }
}

fn handle_transfer_reply(deps: DepsMut, msg: Reply) -> StdResult<Response> {
    // Process the reply and search for the transfer event
    msg.result.into_result().map_err(|err| StdError::generic_err(format!("Transfer failed: {}", err)))?;

    // Find the transfer event in the reply
    let transfer_event = find_transfer_event(&msg.events)
        .ok_or_else(|| StdError::generic_err("Unable to find transfer event"))?;

    // Handle the transfer event and perform necessary actions
    // For example, you might want to extract and use some attributes from the event
    let amount = transfer_event.attributes
        .iter()
        .find(|attr| attr.key == "amount")
        .map(|attr| attr.value.clone())
        .ok_or_else(|| StdError::generic_err("Unable to find transfer amount"))?;

    // Perform actions with the transfer information
    // For example, update some state in the contract
    // SOME_STATE.save(deps.storage, &amount)?;

    Ok(Response::new()
        .add_attribute("action", "handle_transfer_reply")
        .add_attribute("amount", amount))
}

fn find_transfer_event(events: &[Event]) -> Option<&Event> {
    events.iter().find(|e| {
        e.attributes
            .iter()
            .any(|attr| attr.key == "action" && attr.value == "transfer")
    })
}
```

1. Imports and Constant:
   ```rust
   use cosmwasm_std::{DepsMut, Event, Reply, Response, StdError, StdResult};
   const CW20_TRANSFER_REPLY_ID: u64 = 1u64;
   ```
   This imports necessary types from `cosmwasm_std` and defines a constant ID for the CW20 transfer reply.

2. Reply Entry Point:
   ```rust
   #[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
   pub fn reply(deps: DepsMut, _env: Env, msg: Reply) -> StdResult<Response> {
       match msg.id {
           CW20_TRANSFER_REPLY_ID => handle_transfer_reply(deps, msg),
           id => Err(StdError::generic_err(format!("Unknown reply id: {}", id))),
       }
   }
   ```
   This function is the entry point for handling replies. It matches on the reply ID and calls `handle_transfer_reply` for CW20 transfers, or returns an error for unknown IDs.

3. Handle Transfer Reply:
   ```rust
   fn handle_transfer_reply(deps: DepsMut, msg: Reply) -> StdResult<Response> {
       msg.result.into_result().map_err(|err| StdError::generic_err(format!("Transfer failed: {}", err)))?;
       
       let transfer_event = find_transfer_event(&msg.events)
           .ok_or_else(|| StdError::generic_err("Unable to find transfer event"))?;
       
       let amount = transfer_event.attributes
           .iter()
           .find(|attr| attr.key == "amount")
           .map(|attr| attr.value.clone())
           .ok_or_else(|| StdError::generic_err("Unable to find transfer amount"))?;
       
       Ok(Response::new()
           .add_attribute("action", "handle_transfer_reply")
           .add_attribute("amount", amount))
   }
   ```
   This function handles the CW20 transfer reply:
   - It first checks if the transfer was successful.
   - It then finds the transfer event using the `find_transfer_event` function.
   - It extracts the transfer amount from the event's attributes.
   - Finally, it returns a `Response` with attributes indicating the action and amount.

4. Find Transfer Event:
   ```rust
   fn find_transfer_event(events: &[Event]) -> Option<&Event> {
       events.iter().find(|e| {
           e.attributes
               .iter()
               .any(|attr| attr.key == "action" && attr.value == "transfer")
       })
   }
   ```
   This helper function searches through the events to find the one with an attribute where the key is "action" and the value is "transfer".

## Propagation of context between contracts

CosmWasm's design prevents reentrancy attacks by not allowing context to be stored in contract memory. This means that when a contract calls another contract, it can't rely on in-memory state to track the context of that call.

### Methods for state propagation

a. **Events**:
   - All events returned by a submessage can be read from the Reply message.
   - This allows you to propagate context information through events.

   Example:
   ```rust
   // In the calling contract
   let msg = WasmMsg::Execute {
       contract_addr: other_contract.to_string(),
       msg: to_binary(&SomeMsg { /* ... */ })?,
       funds: vec![],
   };
   let submsg = SubMsg::reply_on_success(msg, REPLY_ID);
   
   // In the reply handler
   fn reply(deps: DepsMut, _env: Env, msg: Reply) -> StdResult<Response> {
       let event = msg.events.iter().find(|e| e.type == "wasm").unwrap();
       let context = event.attributes.iter().find(|a| a.key == "context").unwrap().value;
       // Use the context...
   }
   ```

b. **Temporary State Storage**:
   - Use `cw_storage_plus::Item` to store temporary state before sending a submessage.
   - Load this state in the reply handler to manage context across contract calls.

   Example:
   ```rust
   use cw_storage_plus::Item;

   const TEMP_CONTEXT: Item<String> = Item::new("temp_context");

   // Before sending the submessage
   TEMP_CONTEXT.save(deps.storage, &context_to_save)?;
   let submsg = SubMsg::reply_on_success(msg, REPLY_ID);

   // In the reply handler
   fn reply(deps: DepsMut, _env: Env, msg: Reply) -> StdResult<Response> {
       let context = TEMP_CONTEXT.load(deps.storage)?;
       TEMP_CONTEXT.remove(deps.storage);
       // Use the context...
   }
   ```

### Benefits of this approach

   - Prevents reentrancy attacks by not relying on mutable in-memory state.
   - Provides a clear and auditable trail of contract interactions.
   - Allows for complex multi-contract interactions while maintaining security.

### Considerations

   - When using events, be mindful of gas costs as emitting many events can be expensive.
   - When using temporary storage, remember to clean up (remove) the temporary state after use to avoid bloating the contract's storage.
   - Choose between events and temporary storage based on the complexity of your context and the nature of your inter-contract communication.

### Best practices

   - Use descriptive event types and attribute keys to make your code more readable and debuggable.
   - When using temporary storage, use unique keys to avoid conflicts with other parts of your contract.
   - Always validate and sanitize any context information received from events or temporary storage before using it.
