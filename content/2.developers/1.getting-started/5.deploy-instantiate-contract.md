# Deploy and instantiate contracts on-chain

Only optimized **wasm** files can be stored on-chain. Now that you have the `wasm` binary ready, it's time to deploy it to the Archway blockchain so that you can start interacting with your smart contract. You have the option of using the [archwayd daemon](/developers/developer-tools/daemon), the [Archway Developer CLI](/developers/developer-tools/developer-cli) if the contract structure is compatible.

## Additional prerequisites

To execute some of the commands on this page, you will need to have the following command line tools installed:
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download)


## Account creation

To execute a transaction on-chain, you need to have an account. In the [Project Setup](developers/getting-started/setup#creating-an-account) guide, we walked through setting up an account using the Archway Developer CLI. For setting up an account with `archwayd`, please follow this [guide](/developers/developer-tools/daemon).

## Access native tokens

To execute a transaction, you need the chain's native token to pay the transaction fee. For our Testnet, you can obtain free **CONST** tokens to cover transaction fees by using the faucet available on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/archwayhq). For the **Mainnet**, you will need to acquire **ARCH** tokens, which can be done through our [Archway Connect](https://connect.archway.io/get-arch) platform.

## Deploy contract

### Store contract using archway developer cli

If your contract was created using the [Archway Developer CLI](/developers/developer-tools/developer-cli), you can deploy the contracts in your project using the following command:

```shell
archway contracts store
```

If you only want to store one contract from your project, you would set the contract name as shown in the following command, substituting [CONTRACT] with the name of your contract.

```shell
archway contracts store [CONTRACT]
```

For details on how to create a CosmWasm project with the [Archway Developer CLI](/developers/developer-tools/developer-cli), see [Creating a project](/developers/getting-started/setup#creating-a-project).

### Store contract using archwayd

Now you will store the `wasm` binary of the [cw_namespace contract](/developers/getting-started/compile-contract) on-chain and obtain its **Code ID**. This **Code ID** will be used later to create an instance of the **cw_namespace** contract, which will then generate a contract address.

Make sure to update the following in the command:

- Change `mywallet` to the name of the wallet you created via the [Archwayd daemon](/developers/developer-tools/daemon) page.
- It is assumed that you are executing the command in the same directory as the `artifacts` directory and that the name of the wasm file is `cw_nameservice.wasm`. If this is not the case, you should change `artifacts/cw_nameservice.wasm` to the actual location of the file to be stored on-chain.

Execute the following commands to store the contract on-chain:


::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
mainnet

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd tx wasm store artifacts/cw_nameservice.wasm --from mywallet --node https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443 --chain-id archway-1 --gas auto --gas-prices $(archwayd q rewards estimate-fees 1 --node 'https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443' --output json | jq -r '.gas_unit_price | (.amount + .denom)') --gas-adjustment 1.3 -y --output json
```

::

#title1
testnet

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd tx wasm store artifacts/cw_nameservice.wasm --from mywallet --node https://rpc.constantine.archway.io:443 --chain-id constantine-3 --gas auto --gas-prices $(archwayd q rewards estimate-fees 1 --node 'https://rpc.constantine.archway.io:443' --output json | jq -r '.gas_unit_price | (.amount + .denom)') --gas-adjustment 1.3 -y --output json
```

::

::

The following is an example of the output:

```json
{"height":"0","txhash":"7DA7D9091FC874BBB590E24397324DBBC25944730D41B34099E2340776849996","codespace":"","code":0,"data":"","raw_log":"[]","logs":[],"info":"","gas_wanted":"0","gas_used":"0","tx":null,"timestamp":"","events":[]}
```

Now copy the `txhash` and do a search on https://www.mintscan.io and you should find the `Code ID` on the page. The following is an example of the URL if the transaction was done on Testnet: https://www.mintscan.io/archway-testnet/tx/7DA7D9091FC874BBB590E24397324DBBC25944730D41B34099E2340776849996?height=7130816.

An unlimited number of contracts can be instantiated using a `Code ID`. You can see the list of contracts instantiated using a `Code ID` by executing the following command, making sure to change `$CODE_ID` to the actual number:


::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
mainnet

#desc0
::highlight-card

```shell
archwayd query wasm list-contract-by-code $CODE_ID --node https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443 --output json
```

::

#title1
testnet

#desc1
::highlight-card

```shell
archwayd query wasm list-contract-by-code $CODE_ID --node https://rpc.constantine.archway.io:443 --output json
```

::

::


The response should be an empty list since no contracts have been instantiated yet.

```json
{"contracts":[],"pagination":{"next_key":null,"total":"0"}}
```

Before you instantiate a contract using the Code Id and interact with it, let's verify if the code stored on the blockchain is indeed the **cw_namespace.wasm** binary you uploaded.


Download the wasm binary from the chain and compare it to the original binary:

::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
mainnet

#desc0
::highlight-card

```shell
archwayd query wasm code $CODE_ID --node https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443 download.wasm --chain-id archway-1
```

::

#title1
testnet

#desc1
::highlight-card

```shell
archwayd query wasm code $CODE_ID --node https://rpc.constantine.archway.io:443 download.wasm --chain-id constantine-3
```

::

::



The two binaries should be identical. For this action you need to have the `diff` command installed:


::highlight-card

```shell
diff artifacts/cw_nameservice.wasm download.wasm
```

::


If the **diff** command yields an empty output, this indicates that the two files being compared are identical.

## Instantiating the contract

Now that you have stored your contract on-chain and obtained the `Code ID`, you can create an instance of the smart contract using this `Code ID`. Once the contract is instantiated, you will receive a smart contract address that will allow you to execute transactions and perform queries on your contract.

### Instantiate using archwayd

You will need to set the `$CODE_ID` value with the `Code ID` generated from storing the contract on-chain. In the commands below the following actions are being performed:

- Set the initialization message (`INIT`) for the smart contract. It specifies the parameters `purchase_price` and `transfer_price` in JSON format, where the price is defined in terms of amount and denom (denomination, e.g., aconst). It uses the `--no-admin` to not set an admin which means that contract cannot be updated and no rewards metadata cannot be set.
- Execute the actual command that instantiates the smart contract using the stored `CODE_ID` and the `INIT` message.
- Lists all contracts instantiated from the specified `CODE_ID` and outputs the details in JSON format.

::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
mainnet

#desc0
::highlight-card

```shell
# Set the code id
CODE_ID=''

# Prepare the instantiation message
INIT='{"purchase_price":{"amount":"100","denom":"aconst"},"transfer_price":{"amount":"999","denom":"aconst"}}'

# Instantiate the contract
archwayd tx wasm instantiate $CODE_ID "$INIT" --from mywallet --label "name service" --node https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443 --chain-id archway-1 --gas auto --gas-prices $(archwayd q rewards estimate-fees 1 --node 'https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443' --output json | jq -r '.gas_unit_price | (.amount + .denom)') --gas-adjustment 1.3 -y --no-admin

# Check the contract details and account balance
archwayd query wasm list-contract-by-code $CODE_ID --node https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443 --output json

CONTRACT=$(archwayd query wasm list-contract-by-code $CODE_ID --node https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443 --output json | jq -r '.contracts[-1]')

echo $CONTRACT

# See the contract details
archwayd query wasm contract $CONTRACT --node https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443 --chain-id archway-1

# Check the contract balance
archwayd query bank balances $CONTRACT --node https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443 --chain-id archway-1

# Upon instantiation the cw_nameservice contract will store the instatiation message data in the contract's storage with the storage key "config".
# Query the entire contract state
archwayd query wasm contract-state all $CONTRACT --node https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443 --chain-id archway-1
```

::

#title1
testnet

#desc1
::highlight-card

```shell
# Set the code id
CODE_ID='3341'

# Prepare the instantiation message
INIT='{"purchase_price":{"amount":"100","denom":"aconst"},"transfer_price":{"amount":"999","denom":"aconst"}}'

# Instantiate the contract
archwayd tx wasm instantiate 3341 "'{"purchase_price":{"amount":"100","denom":"aconst"},"transfer_price":{"amount":"999","denom":"aconst"}}'" --from mywallet --label "name service" --node https://rpc.constantine.archway.io:443 --chain-id constantine-3 --gas auto --gas-prices $(archwayd q rewards estimate-fees 1 --node 'https://rpc.constantine.archway.io:443' --output json | jq -r '.gas_unit_price | (.amount + .denom)') --gas-adjustment 1.3 -y --no-admin

# Check the contract details and account balance

CONTRACT=$(archwayd query wasm list-contract-by-code $CODE_ID --node https://rpc.constantine.archway.io:443 --output json | jq -r '.contracts[-1]')

echo $CONTRACT

# Query the entire contract state
archwayd query wasm contract-state all $CONTRACT --node https://rpc.constantine.archway.io:443
