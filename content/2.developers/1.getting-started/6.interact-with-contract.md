# Interacting with your contract

Now that your contract is deployed and instantiated, it's time to start interacting with it. This involves generating transactions and retrieving information from the contract.

## Querying contract data

Queries read data from the blockchain without altering any stored information, so they do not incur any gas fees.

There are several types of queries we can perform, but a common type of query we are interested in is the **contract-state** query, which we will execute in **smart mode**. This allows us to run queries with specific arguments to filter the resultset instead of retrieving the entire contract data or metadata.

If you have created the [increment contract project](/developers/getting-started/setup), we will show you how to use the `Archway Developer CLI` and `archwayd` to get the contract's `count` state.

### Query using Archway Developer CLI

The following is the general command structure for executing a query:

::highlight-card
```bash
archway contracts query smart CONTRACT [STDININPUT] [--json] [--log-level debug|error|info|warn] [--no-validation] [--args <value> | --args-file <value>| ]
```
::

A basic example for the `increment` contract would be:

::highlight-card
```bash
archway contracts query smart increment --args '{"get_count": {}}'
```
::

An example of the output would be:

::highlight-card
```bash
{
  "count": 0
}
```
::

### Query using archwayd

Please make sure to substitute `[CONTRACT-ADDRESS]` for your contract's address.

::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
mainnet
#desc0
::highlight-card


```bash
archwayd query wasm contract-state smart [CONTRACT-ADDRESS] '{"get_count": {}}' --node https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443 --chain-id archway-1
```

::

#title1
testnet

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd query wasm contract-state smart [CONTRACT-ADDRESS] '{"get_count": {}}' --node https://rpc.constantine.archway.io:443 --chain-id constantine-3
```

::

::

An example of the output would be:

```
data:
  count: 1
```

### Deeper dive

Why was the query argument **{"get_count": {}}**?

The query argument **{"get_count": {}}** is used to match the expected input format defined in the smart contract's Rust code. This specific JSON structure corresponds to the `QueryMsg::GetCount` variant in the contract's query function.

If we open **src/contract.rs** in your project and inspect the function **pub fn query**, you will see the case matching statement that corresponds to our JSON query:

```rust
pub fn query(deps: Deps, _env: Env, msg: QueryMsg) -> StdResult<Binary> {
  match msg {
      QueryMsg::GetCount {} => to_binary(&query_count(deps)?), // Here it is
  }
}
```

Here's a detailed breakdown:

- **pub fn query**: This is the query function that handles all the queries for the contract. It takes three parameters: `deps` (dependencies), `_env` (environment), and `msg` (message).
- **msg: QueryMsg**: The `msg` parameter is of type `QueryMsg`, which is an enum representing different types of query messages the contract can handle.
- **match msg**: This line matches the `msg` parameter against different possible variants of the `QueryMsg` enum.
- **QueryMsg::GetCount {}**: This variant corresponds to the **{"get_count": {}}** query argument. When this variant is matched, it calls the `query_count` function to get the current count.
- **to_binary(&query_count(deps)?)**: This line converts the result of the `query_count` function into a binary format suitable for returning to the caller.

To understand why the query argument is structured this way, let's look at the `QueryMsg` enum, which is defined in **src/msg.rs**:

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub enum QueryMsg {
    GetCount {},
}
```

- **#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]**: This line uses Rust macros to automatically generate code for serialization, deserialization, cloning, debugging, partial equality, and JSON schema.
- **#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]**: This attribute ensures that all enum variants are converted to snake_case when serialized to JSON.
- **pub enum QueryMsg**: This defines the `QueryMsg` enum.
- **GetCount {}**: This variant represents a query to get the current count.

When you execute the query command with **{"get_count": {}}**, it gets serialized into a `QueryMsg::GetCount {}` variant and passed to the `query` function. The `match` statement in the `query` function identifies this variant and calls the `query_count` function, which retrieves the current count and returns it as a binary response.

By understanding this structure, you can see how the JSON query argument maps directly to the Rust code in the smart contract, enabling precise and effective interactions with the contract's state.

## Executing transactions

To increment the counter value, you'll need to execute a transaction that calls the function **pub fn try_increment** in **src/contract.rs**. This function is already public, but the transaction execution is handled by the function **pub fn execute** in **src/contract.rs**, which does pattern matching to call **try_increment**.

### Increment count using the Archway Developer CLI


::highlight-card
```bash
archway contracts execute increment --args '{"increment": {}}'
```
::


::alert{variant="info"}
If you ever receive an out of gas error you can always use the **--gas-adjustment** flag and set a value of 1.5 or more.

### Sending an Increment transaction using archwayd

Please make sure to substitute `[CONTRACT-ADDRESS]` for your contract's address.

::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
mainnet
#desc0
::highlight-card


```bash
archwayd tx wasm execute --chain-id archway-1 [CONTRACT-ADDRESS]  '{"increment": {}}' --from my-wallet --node https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443 --gas auto --gas-prices $(archwayd q rewards estimate-fees 1 --node 'https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443' --output json | jq -r '.gas_unit_price | (.amount + .denom)') --gas-adjustment 1.3
```

::

#title1
testnet

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd tx wasm execute --chain-id constantine-3 archway188u72zstacfq4uknszr0cqry8vn68ynrcfcee4xjlmk6v2vhewysnkr798  '{"increment": {}}' --from my-wallet --node https://rpc.constantine.archway.io:443 --gas auto --gas-prices $(archwayd q rewards estimate-fees 1 --node 'https://rpc.constantine.archway.io:443' --output json | jq -r '.gas_unit_price | (.amount + .denom)') --gas-adjustment 1.3
```

Example output:

::highlight-card
```bash
✔ Enter the name or address of the account that will send the transaction … mywallet
Executing contract increment2
  Chain: constantine-3
  Signer: mywallet

### Why is the Argument **{"increment": {}}**?

The argument **{"increment": {}}** is used to match the expected input format defined in the smart contract's Rust code. This specific JSON structure corresponds to the `ExecuteMsg::Increment` variant in the contract's execute function.

If we open **src/contract.rs** and inspect the **pub fn execute** function, we will see the pattern matching statement that corresponds to our JSON argument:

```rust
pub fn execute(
  deps: DepsMut,
  _env: Env,
  info: MessageInfo,
  msg: ExecuteMsg,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
  match msg {
    ExecuteMsg::Increment {} => try_increment(deps), // Here it is
    ExecuteMsg::Reset { count } => try_reset(deps, info, count),
  }
}
```

### Understanding the `execute` Function

Here's a detailed breakdown:

- **pub fn execute**: This is the main function that handles all the execute messages for the contract. It takes four parameters: `deps` (mutable dependencies), `_env` (environment), `info` (message information), and `msg` (message).
- **msg: ExecuteMsg**: The `msg` parameter is of type `ExecuteMsg`, which is an enum representing different types of execute messages the contract can handle.
- **match msg**: This line matches the `msg` parameter against different possible variants of the `ExecuteMsg` enum.
- **ExecuteMsg::Increment {}**: This variant corresponds to the **{"increment": {}}** JSON argument. When this variant is matched, it calls the `try_increment` function to increment the count.
- **ExecuteMsg::Reset { count }**: This variant matches the **{"reset": {"count": <value>}}** JSON argument. When this variant is matched, it calls the `try_reset` function to reset the count to the specified value.

### Understanding the `ExecuteMsg` Enum

To understand why the execute argument is structured this way, let's look at the `ExecuteMsg` enum, which is typically defined in **src/msg.rs**:

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub enum ExecuteMsg {
    Increment {},
    Reset { count: i32 },
}
```

- **#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]**: This line uses Rust macros to automatically generate code for serialization, deserialization, cloning, debugging, partial equality, and JSON schema.
- **#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]**: This attribute ensures that all enum variants are converted to snake_case when serialized to JSON.
- **pub enum ExecuteMsg**: This defines the `ExecuteMsg` enum.
- **Increment {}**: This variant represents a message to increment the count.
- **Reset { count: i32 }**: This variant represents a message to reset the count to a specific value.

### How the Execute Command Works

When you execute the command with **{"increment": {}}**, it gets serialized into an `ExecuteMsg::Increment {}` variant and passed to the `execute` function. The `match` statement in the `execute` function identifies this variant and calls the `try_increment` function, which increments the count and returns a response.

By understanding this structure, you can see how the JSON execute argument maps directly to the Rust code in the smart contract, enabling precise and effective interactions with the contract's state.

If our **{"increment": {}}** transaction succeeded and we query **count** again, it will have increased by **1**:

```bash
archway contracts query smart increment --args '{"get_count": {}}'
```

Now outputs:

```bash
{
  "count": 1
}
```

This shows that the contract's state has been updated as expected.
















Why is the argument {**"increment":** {}}?

If we open **src/contract.rs** and inspect the **pub fn execute** function, we'll see a pattern matching statement that matches our JSON argument:

::highlight-card
```rust
pub fn execute(
  deps: DepsMut,
  _env: Env,
  info: MessageInfo,
  msg: ExecuteMsg,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
  match msg {
    ExecuteMsg::Increment {} => try_increment(deps), // Here it is
    ExecuteMsg::Reset { count } => try_reset(deps, info, count),
  }
}
```
::

As you can see, **enum** attributes again are converted. **ExecuteMsg::Increment {}** becomes {"**increment**": {}} in the CLI.

If our { "**increment**": {}} transaction succeeded and we query **count** again, it will have increased by **1***:
::highlight-card

```bash
archway contracts query smart increment --args '{"get_count": {}}'
```

::

Now outputs:

::highlight-card

```bash
{
  "count": 1
}
```
