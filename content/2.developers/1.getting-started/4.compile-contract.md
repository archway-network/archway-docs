# Compiling a contract

To deploy your smart contracts to the Archway blockchain, you need to build an optimized version of your contract, which will be generated as a **.wasm** executable.

For building and optimizing your contracts, we use the [Rust Optimizer](https://github.com/CosmWasm/optimizer). This tool allows for compiling and optimizing multiple contracts within a workspace project, a feature that the [Archway Developer CLI](/developers/developer-tools/developer-cli) utilizes. This process is handled via [Docker](/developers/getting-started/install#docker), making Docker a required dependency.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, please refer to the [Installation of Development Tools](/developers/getting-started/install) guide to install the necessary dependencies. Specifically, ensure that [Docker](/developers/getting-started/install#docker) is installed and running.

## Compiling with the Archway Developer CLI

The [Archway Developer CLI](/developers/developer-tools/developer-cli) has a unique project structure with specific requirements for the CLI to function correctly. If you created a smart contract project using the Archway Developer CLI, for example, if you went through the [Project Setup guide](/developers/getting-started/setup), you can compile all contracts in your project by executing the following command in the root of your project:

```shell
archway contracts build
```

To build a single contract within your project, execute the following command, replacing `[CONTRACT]` with the actual name of your contract:

```shell
archway contracts build [CONTRACT]
```

The following is an example of the output:

## Compiling other contracts

If your contract was not built using the Archway Developer CLI, you can use the method below to compile your contract. Please note that the following method will also work for contracts created using the Archway Developer CLI.

For this example, we will download and compile an open-source smart contract. Begin by downloading the [cw-contracts](https://github.com/InterWasm/cw-contracts) repository. You will be compiling the **nameservice** contract. Execute the following set of commands:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/InterWasm/cw-contracts
cd cw-contracts
git checkout main
cd contracts/nameservice
```

Then, run the following command to compile the contract:

```shell
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/code \
  --mount type=volume,source="$(basename "$(pwd)")_cache",target=/target \
  --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
  cosmwasm/optimizer:0.16.0
```

This command will optimize the contract code and generate an optimized **cw_nameservice.wasm** file which is then stored in the **artifacts** directory.

The following is an example of the output:

::highlight-card

```bash
Building project /code ...
Building cw_nameservice with features {}

note: if you need to support cargo 1.38 or earlier, you can symlink `config` to `config.toml`
