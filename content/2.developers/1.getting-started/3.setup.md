# Project Setup

A new Archway project is a Rust project that will compile to **wasm** using the **archwayd** binary, which is an implementation of a cosmos zone with **wasm** smart contracts enabled.

Let's set up a new project, using the [Developer CLI](/developers/developer-tools/developer-cli/developer-cli), 

## Creating an account

Use the command **archway accounts** to view wallets in your key ring, or create a new wallet using the flag **--add <account label>**
::highlight-card

```bash
archway accounts --add "mywallet"
```

::
Example output:
::highlight-card

```bash
Enter keyring passphrase:

- name: mywallet
  type: local
  address: archway1gtmpktrrnu2qwnweyulwptv6wukd3edpxugkzn
  pubkey: archwaypub1addwnpepqdhls9u834myuuajgstf8esyqttn3ph6r5y6kr5nnfx5uc06al9hut8r9ac
  mnemonic: ""
  threshold: 0
  pubkeys: []


**Important** write this mnemonic phrase in a safe place.
It is the only way to recover your account if you ever forget your password.

## Creating a project

The **archway new** command starts a new project. You can press **enter** to accept the default options for any of the project configuration questions.
::highlight-card

```bash
archway new
```

::
Example Output:
::highlight-card

```bash
Creating new Archway dapp...

Configure environment (Y/N default: N)?: Y

1. Testnet
2. Localhost
3. Mainnet

Select environment type (1-3 default: 1): 1

1. Constantine [stable]
2. Titus [nightly]

Select a testnet to use (1-2 default: 1): 1
Use Docker to run "archwayd" daemon (Y/N default: N)?: Y
Use starter template? (Y/N default: N): Y

1. Increment
[https://github.com/drewstaylor/archway-template/blob/main/README.md]

Select starter template (1-1): 1

Name of project (e.g. "My Project"): First Archway Project

## Configuring a project

When you have created a new project, navigate to the folder where the project was installed and print your config using the command **archway config**.

If this configuration isn't to your liking, you can always modify it by editing the **archway config** file in the root folder of the project.
::highlight-card

```bash
cd my-project
archway config
```

::
Outputs:
::highlight-card

```bash
Printing environment settings...
{
  title: 'My Project',
  version: '0.0.1',
  network: {...},
  developer: {...},
  path: '/home/my-system-path/my-project',
  type: 'Increment'
}
```

::
The **type** parameter simply keeps track of which "**starter template**" you used during project creation.

In **network** you'll find settings for the network you're working on. Supported network types are **mainnet**, **testnet** and **localhost**. Additionally, there are 2 testnet choices: **stable [constantine]** and **nightly [titus]**.

**developer** contains a history of your deployments and holds scripts for building, testing, optimizing and deploying your project. In **developer.scripts** you'll have granular control over how your project is compiled, executed and deployed, but it already "just works" without any tinkering.

## Network settings and migrating between networks

During a project's life cycle you may want to migrate or change your network settings. For example, switching from **testnet** to a **mainnet** deployment.

Migrate between networks using the command **archway network**. This will print your current settings and give the option to change networks.
::highlight-card

```bash
archway network
```

::
Example output:
::highlight-card

```bash
Printing network settings...
1. Testnet* [constantine, titus]
2. Localhost
3. Mainnet [triomphe]
Migrate to another network (Y/N default: N)?: n
Ok!
```

::
::alert{variant="info"}
If you migrate between networks by answering **y** or **yes** and following the additional migration questions, your previous deployments history and script customisations will remain in tact.
