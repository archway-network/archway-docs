# Project Setup

A new Archway project involves creating a Rust-based application that compiles to WebAssembly (wasm), a binary instruction format optimized for efficient execution. Setting up a new Archway project is most straightforward when using the [Archway Developer CLI](/developers/developer-tools/developer-cli). Let's begin the process of creating a new project with the help of this Developer CLI.

## Creating an account

Use the command **archway accounts list** to view wallets in your key ring, or create a new wallet using:

::highlight-card
```bash
archway accounts new
```
::

You will be asked to enter a name for the account.

Example output with certain sensitive details altered or omitted:

::highlight-card

```bash
‚úÖ Account testwallet successfully created!

Address: archway1qs2qnjvzlkgt0gpekr2c3pld0eu3tq8yw2kwgc

Public Key
  Algo: secp256k1
  Key: Ak++QeiMs4HhXQe3JLpM/R+nU2pzvOWT6GsJZacTfyr6

Recovery phrase: <phrase removed>

‚ö†Ô∏è Important: write this mnemonic phrase in a safe place. It is the only way to recover your account if you forget your password.

## Creating a project

The **archway new** command starts a new project.

::highlight-card

```bash
archway new
```
::

Example output with certain details altered or omitted:

::highlight-card

```bash
‚úî Enter the name of the new project ‚Ä¶ Project 1
‚úî Select a chain to use ‚Ä∫ Archway
‚úî Choose a name for your contract ‚Ä¶ increment
‚úî Choose a starter template ‚Ä∫ Increment

## Configuring a project

When you have created a new project, navigate to the folder where the project was installed and print your config using the command:

::highlight-card

```bash
archway config show
```
::

**An example output**:

::highlight-card

```bash
Chain id: constantine-3
Contracts path: ./contracts
Keyring backend: os
Keyring files path: /Users/testuser/.config/archway/keys
```
::

If this configuration isn't to your liking, you can always modify it by executing the **archway config set** with the key and value you would like to update.

**Usage:**

::highlight-card

```bash
$ archway config set KEY VALUE [--json] [--log-level debug|error|info|warn] [-g]
```
::

**Arguments:**
::highlight-card

```bash
KEY (required) (chain-id|contracts-path|default-account|keyring-backend|keyring-path) The config key to set
VALUE (required) The config value
```
::

In **Chain ID** specifies the chain the project is currently configured to interact with. You can use the following command to easily switch to a different chain:

::highlight-card

```bash
$ config chains use <chain-id>
```
::

You will need to enter the Chain ID that you will want to switch to. Currently "**constantine-3**" for Testnet and "**archway-1**" for Mainnet.
