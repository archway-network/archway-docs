# Integrated development environment (IDE) setup

This tutorial will guide you through the process of setting up an IDE for developing CosmWasm smart contracts. Since CosmWasm contracts are currently built using Rust, this tutorial will focus on setting up the IDE for Rust development.

## Prerequisites

Please refer to the [Installation](./install) guide to install the Rust compiler (**rustc**) before proceeding.

## Install visual studio code (VS Code)

VS Code is a very popular, free, and open-source IDE. It has a rich source code editor, integrated git, and debugging with various extensions that add a lot of features and support for various languages including Rust, Go, C++, Java, Python, PHP, etc. The IDE is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.

Please refer to the steps below for your respective operating system:

1. <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=534106" target="_blank">Download Visual Studio Code</a> for macOS.
2. Open the browser's download list and locate the downloaded app or archive.
3. If archive, extract the archive contents. Use double-click for some browsers or select the 'magnifying glass' icon with Safari.
4. Drag Visual Studio Code.app to the Applications folder, making it available in the macOS Launchpad.
5. Open VS Code from the Applications folder, by double-clicking the icon.
6. Add VS Code to your Dock by right-clicking on the icon, located in the Dock, to bring up the context menu and choosing Options, Keep in Dock.

## Configure vs code

To enable Rust support in VS Code, you need to install a few extensions, namely rust-analyzer and CodeLLdb, that provide syntax highlighting, code completion, debugging capabilities and other essential functionalities.

### Rust-analyzer

The “rust-analyzer” extension is a language server for the Rust programming language, which provides features such as code completion, error checking, and documentation while writing Rust code in VS Code.

Follow these steps to install the extension:

1. Go to the “Extension” panel
2. In the “Search” field enter “rust-analyzer”
3. In the primary window on the right click the “install” button

For additional information as to the benefits and features of Rust-Analyzer, see the Rust-Analyzer <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html" target="_blank">User Manual</a>.

### CodeLLdb

The “codeLLdbr” extension is a native debugger used for debugging Rust and other compiled languages.

Follow these steps to install the extension:

Go to the “Extension” panel
In the “Search” field enter “CodeLLdb”
In the primary window on the right click the “install” button

For full details on how to use the CodeLLdb extension, please see the <a href="https://github.com/vadimcn/codelldb/blob/v1.9.0/MANUAL.md" target="_blank">Manual</a>.

### Basic rust program

Let's test if you are able to write and execute Rust programs within VS Code.
Create a new file “main.rs” and add the following to the file:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, Archway!");
}
```

Launch a terminal within VS Code by going to “Terminal -> New Terminal” and execute the following command to compile the program:

```bash
rustc main.rs`
```

To execute the program, use the following command:

```bash
./main
```
<br>

::alert{variant="info"}
On Windows this might be “./main.exe”.
#title
**Note**
::

The output of the program should be:
`Hello, Archway!`
