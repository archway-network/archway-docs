# Installation

To get started developing on the Archway Network, you will need to have the the following dependencies installed.

## Dependencies
### Required
- [Rustc](#rustc 'Install Rust')
- [Cargo](#cargo 'Install Cargo')
- [Cargo Generate](#cargo-generate 'Install Cargo Generate')
- [wasm32](#wasm32 'Install wasm32')
- [Node.js](#nodejs-and-npm 'Install Node.js and NPM')
- [Archway Developer CLI](#archway-developer-cli 'Install develolper CLI')
- <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker" target="_blank" >Docker</a>

### Optional
- [Archwayd](#archwayd 'Install Archway Daemon')

## Rustc

**rustc**, provided by the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank" title="Rust Homepage">Rust</a> project maintainers, is the compiler for the Rust programming language. **rustc** takes your Rust source code and produces binary code as a library or an executable.

To install Rust, follow the instructions for your operating system <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install" target="_blank" title="Install Rust">here</a>.

## Cargo

Cargo is the Rust package manager, like **go get** for Golang or **npm** is for JavaScript. Cargo comes with Rust if you installed **rustc** using **rustup**.

If you did not already install **rustc** with **rustup**, or don't have **cargo** in your command line path, see the instructions for installing Cargo <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html" target="_blank" title="Install Rust">here</a>.

## Cargo Generate

The **cargo-generate** tool creates a new Rust project quickly by leveraging a pre-existing code base.

Archway uses **cargo-generate** and **cargo-run-script** to provide and manage project templates for dapp development.

To install **cargo-generate** with **vendored-openssl**, and the **cargo-run-script** module, run the commands:
::highlight-card

```bash
cargo install cargo-generate --features vendored-openssl
cargo install cargo-run-script
```

::

## wasm32

The **wasm32** <a href="https://rustup.rs/" target="_blank" >rustup</a> target is a 32-bit "bare wasm" module for producing <a href="https://webassembly.org/" target="_blank" >WebAssembly</a> output that makes zero assumptions about your host machine and environment (hence the `-unknown-unkown` suffix). It's required by the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@archwayhq/cli" target="_blank" >Developer CLI</a>, as of version <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@archwayhq/cli/v/1.2.1" target="_blank" >`1.2.1`</a>, for optimizing **wasm** output for on-chain storage of binaries.

Install **wasm32** using the following command:
::highlight-card

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

::

## Node.js and Npm

**npm** is a package manager for JavaScript and Node.js. Archway uses **npm** for installing and updating the developer CLI.

For installing **node.js** and **npm**, see instructions for your operating system <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm" target="_blank">here</a>.

::alert{variant="info"}
**@archwayhq/cli** requires Node.js version 14 or higher, but some older versions in the `beta` release track required Node.js version 17. You can check which version you have installed using the command **archway --version**.

<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@archwayhq/cli?activeTab=versions" target="_blank" >See all availble versions of @archwayhq/cli</a>

## Docker

<a href="https://docs.docker.com/" target="_blank" title="Install Docker">Docker</a> is needed for the Developer CLI to use the <a href="https://github.com/CosmWasm/rust-optimizer" target="_blank" >rust optimizer</a>. Make sure to follow all the steps with **root** access to prevent conflicts and confusions on the deployment process which requires root permission. You can use <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/" target="_blank" title="Install Docker">Docker Desktop</a> or <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/" target="_blank" title="Install Docker">Docker Engine</a>.

::alert{variant="warning"}
For Linux users, it's recommended to run the Docker daemon in <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/" target="_blank"> **Rootless Mode**</a>
#title
Warning

## Archway Developer CLI

You can install the [Archway CLI](/developers/developer-tools/developer-cli) by using <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm" target="_blank" >npm</a>

::highlight-card

```bash
npm install -g @archwayhq/cli
```
::

::alert{variant="info"}
Since the release of [Archway CLI v2](/developers/developer-tools/developer-cli), **archwayd** is no longer a dependency for the Developer CLI.

## Archwayd (optional)

**archwayd** is an implementation of a Cosmos zone with **wasm** smart contracts enabled, and which adds new modules for developer rewards and for executing **wasm**.

To build **archwayd**, you can download the <a href="https://github.com/archway-network/archway/releases" target="_blank" >latest release</a>, as building **archwayd** from source is not recommended.


You can download the latest release of the pre-built binary from the <a href='https://github.com/archway-network/archway/releases' target='_blank'>releases page</a>.

For Linux, and depending on your architecture:

::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
amd64

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
wget https://github.com/archway-network/archway/releases/download/$$archwayVersion$$/archwayd_linux_amd64
```

::

#title1
arm64

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
wget https://github.com/archway-network/archway/releases/download/$$archwayVersion$$/archwayd_linux_arm64

```

::

::

### Verify the integrity of the binary

You can now verify the download by generating the sha256 hash for the downloaded file:

::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
amd64

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
sha256sum archwayd_linux_amd64
```

::

#title1
arm64

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
sha256sum archwayd_linux_arm64

```

::

::

Using the _sha256sum_ should give you a string (i.e.
_4dd95ee0729b6593c9c390bde6e0c7bf3af0957d7f323e216b76ddb663fa7bc7_).

You can then download the sha256 checksum file relative to the release file:

::highlight-card

```bash
wget archwaysha256.txt https://github.com/archway-network/archway/releases/download/$$archwayVersion$$/archwayd_$$archwayVersion$$_checksums.txt

```

::

and you can compare that the sha256 hash strings match, By doing so, you are ensuring that the downloaded file matches the actual release file.

### Add executable permissions

After downloading the file, you can add executable permissions to it using the chmod command:

::highlight-card

```bash
chmod +x archwayd_linux_amd64
```

::

The above command makes the binary executable.

### Move the binary to the chosen directory

You can now move the binary to a directory in your PATH. The **/usr/local/bin directory** is commonly used for custom user programs not managed by the distribution package manager and is usually included in the **PATH**. You can move your file there with the **mv** command and also rename it to **archwayd** at the same time:

::highlight-card

```bash
sudo mv archwayd_linux_amd64 /usr/local/bin/archwayd
```

::
