# Installation

To get started developing on the Archway Network, you will need to have the the following dependencies installed.

## Required Dependencies

- [Rustc](#rustc 'Install Rust')
- [Cargo](#cargo 'Install Cargo')
- [Cargo Generate](#cargo-generate 'Install Cargo Generate')
- [wasm32](#wasm32 'Install wasm32')
- [Archwayd](#archwayd 'Install Archway Daemon')
- [Node.js](#nodejs-and-npm 'Install Node.js and NPM')
- [Archway Developer CLI](#archway-developer-cli 'Install develolper CLI')

### Optional Dependencies


<a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker" target="_blank" title="Install Docker">Docker</a> 

For local installations, you need root access to run **docker**. Make sure to follow all the steps with **root** access to prevent conflicts and confusions on the deployment process which requires root permission.

::alert{variant="warning"}
For Linux users, it's recommended to run the Docker daemon in <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/" target="_blank"> **Rootless Mode**</a>
#title
Warning
::

If you prefer, you can use <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/" target="_blank" title="Install Docker">Docker Engine</a> instead of Docker Desktop.

<a href="https://go.dev/doc/install" target="_blank" >Golang</a>


In order to run **archwayd**, you will need to install <a href="https://go.dev/doc/install" target="_blank" >Golang</a>.

If you are using Ubuntu, for example, you would launch the command:
::highlight-card

```bash
sudo apt install golang
```

::


## Rustc

**rustc**, provided by the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank" title="Rust Homepage">Rust</a> project maintainers, is the compiler for the Rust programming language. **rustc** takes your Rust source code and produces binary code as a library or an executable.

To install Rust, follow the instructions for your operating system <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install" target="_blank" title="Install Rust">here</a>.

## Cargo

Cargo is the Rust package manager, like **go get** for Golang or **npm** is for JavaScript. Cargo comes with Rust if you installed **rustc** using **rustup**.

If you did not already install **rustc** with **rustup**, or don't have **cargo** in your command line path, see the instructions for installing Cargo <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html" target="_blank" title="Install Rust">here</a>.

## Cargo Generate

The **cargo-generate** tool creates a new Rust project quickly by leveraging a pre-existing code base.

Archway uses **cargo-generate** and **cargo-run-script** to provide and manage project templates for dapp development.

To install **cargo-generate** with **vendored-openssl**, and the **cargo-run-script** module, run the commands:
::highlight-card

```bash
cargo install cargo-generate --features vendored-openssl
cargo install cargo-run-script
```

::

## wasm32

The **wasm32** <a href="https://rustup.rs/" target="_blank" >rustup</a> target is a 32-bit "bare wasm" module for producing <a href="https://webassembly.org/" target="_blank" >WebAssembly</a> output that makes zero assumptions about your host machine and environment (hence the `-unknown-unkown` suffix). It's required by the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@archwayhq/cli" target="_blank" >Developer CLI</a>, as of version <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@archwayhq/cli/v/1.2.1" target="_blank" >`1.2.1`</a>, for optimizing **wasm** output for on-chain storage of binaries.

Install **wasm32** using the following command:
::highlight-card

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

::


## Archwayd

**archwayd** is an implementation of a Cosmos zone with **wasm** smart contracts enabled.

Originally forked from the <a href="https://github.com/cosmos/gaia" target="_blank" >cosmos/gaia repository</a>, **archwayd** adds new modules for developer rewards and for executing **wasm**, but otherwise the **archwayd** binary functions just like `gaiad`.

To build **archwayd**, you can download the <a href="https://github.com/archway-network/archway/releases" target="_blank" >latest release</a> or use the **archwaynetwork/archwayd** <a href="https://www.docker.com/" title="Docker Homepage" target="_blank" >Docker</a>. Building **archwayd** from source is not recommended.

<!--
### Install Archwayd from Source
Building archway from source requires **Go 1.17+**.
Get source code:
::highlight-card

```bash
git clone https://github.com/archway-network/archway.git
cd archway
```


::



Build and install:
::highlight-card

```bash
make install
```

::



::alert{variant="info"}
Docker is a required dependency of the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@archwayhq/cli" target="_blank">Developer CLI</a> for optimizing smart contracts for uploading to the blockchain via `rust-optimizer`
#title
Info
::

For full installation and configuration parameters, see <a href="https://github.com/archway-network/archway/blob/main/README.md" target="_blank">README.md</a>.

### Install Archwayd Using Docker

Get source code:
::highlight-card

```bash
git clone https://github.com/archway-network/archway.git
cd archway
```

::
Build and install:
::highlight-card

```bash
docker build -t ghcr.io/archway-network/archwayd:v1.0.1 .
```

::
Or pull from Docker Hub:
::highlight-card

```
docker pull ghcr.io/archway-network/archwayd:v1.0.1
```

::

::alert{variant="info"}
To simplify using the Docker container, set an alias with the home path and the proper image tag (replacing `<network-name>`). :

::highlight-card

```bash
alias archwayd="docker run --rm -it -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway archwaynetwork/archwayd:<network-name>"
```

::
After setting the alias, you can use the other **archwayd** commands without typing the verbose Docker run command.
#title
Info
::

For more information on running **archwayd** with the `archway-network/archwayd` Docker container, see <a href="https://github.com/archway-network/archway#dockerized" target="_blank">here</a>.


-->

You can download the latest release of the pre-built binary from the <a href='https://github.com/archway-network/archway/releases' target='_blank'>releases page</a>.


For Linux, and depending on your architecture:


::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
amd64

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
wget https://github.com/archway-network/archway/releases/download/v1.0.1/archwayd_linux_amd64
```

::

#title1
arm64

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
wget https://github.com/archway-network/archway/releases/download/v1.0.1/archwayd_linux_arm64

```

::

::

### Verify the integrity of the binary

You can now verify the download by generating the sha256 hash for the downloaded file:







::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
amd64

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
sha256sum archwayd_linux_amd64
```

::

#title1
arm64

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
sha256sum archwayd_linux_arm64

```

::

::



Using the *sha256sum* should give you a string (i.e.
*4dd95ee0729b6593c9c390bde6e0c7bf3af0957d7f323e216b76ddb663fa7bc7*).

You can then download the sha256 checksum file relative to the release file:

::highlight-card
```bash
wget archwaysha256.txt https://github.com/archway-network/archway/releases/download/v1.0.1/archwayd_v1.0.1_checksums.txt

```
::

and you can compare that the sha256 hash strings match, By doing so, you are ensuring that the downloaded file matches the actual release file.

### Add executable permissions

After downloading the file, you can add executable permissions to it using the chmod command:

::highlight-card
```bash
chmod +x archwayd_linux_amd64
```
::


The above command makes the binary executable.

### Move the binary to the chosen directory
You can now move the binary to a directory in your PATH. The **/usr/local/bin directory** is commonly used for custom user programs not managed by the distribution package manager and is usually included in the **PATH**. You can move your file there with the **mv** command and also rename it to **archwayd** at the same time:

::highlight-card
```bash
sudo mv archwayd_linux_amd64 /usr/local/bin/archwayd
```
::

## Use the archwayd docker image

As an alternative, you can also use <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker" target="_blank" title="Install Docker">Docker</a> (make sure to install it).


::alert{variant="warning"}
For Linux users, it's recommended to run the Docker daemon in <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/" target="_blank" title="Docker Rootless mode">Rootless Mode</a>.
#title
Warning
::


### Pull the docker image


You can pull the docker image from the following repositories:

- <a href="https://github.com/archway-network/archway/pkgs/container/archwayd" target="_blank">Production</a>

- <a href="https://github.com/archway-network/archway/pkgs/container/archwayd-debug" target="_blank">Development and Debugging</a>

Make sure to pull the docker image relative to the latest <a href="https://github.com/archway-network/archway/releases" target="_blank">release</a>.


For example, to connect to the **Constantine** testnet, issue the following command:

::highlight-card

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/archway-network/archwayd:v1.0.1
```

::
::alert{variant="info"}
Make sure to always use the image tag that points to the network you want to connect.
#title
Info
::




### Set up the PATH


By default, the Docker image runs the `archwayd` binary, so you should specify the arguments for `archwayd` right after the image name. For better usage, mount an external volume at `/root/.archway` to persist the daemon home path across different runs. For example, if you want to add a key:

::highlight-card

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway \
  ghcr.io/archway-network/archwayd:v1.0.1 \
  keys add test-key
```

::

And then list all keys:

::highlight-card

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway \
  ghcr.io/archway-network/archwayd:v1.0.1 \
  keys list
```

::

It's also important to notice that, when running a node in a network, you'll need to expose the container ports for external connectivity. The image exposes the following ports:

- **1317**: Rest server
- **26656**: Tendermint P2P
- **26657**: Tendermint RPC

::alert{variant="info"}
To simplify using the Docker container, you can set an alias with the home path and the proper image tag, like:

::highlight-card

```bash
alias archwayd="docker run --rm -it -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway ghcr.io/archway-network/archwayd:v1.0.1"
```

::

#title
Info
::

After setting the alias with the above tip, you can use the other **archwayd** commands without typing the verbose Docker run command.
For the sake of comprehensive documentation, the full Docker command is shown. Just remember that by setting the alias you can simply use **archwayd** instead of the Docker command.



## Node.js and Npm

**npm** is a package manager for JavaScript and Node.js. Archway uses **npm** for installing and updating the developer CLI.

For installing **node.js** and **npm**, see instructions for your operating system <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm" target="_blank">here</a>.

::alert{variant="info"}
**@archwayhq/cli** requires Node.js version 14 or higher, but some older versions in the `beta` release track required Node.js version 17. You can check which version you have installed using the command **archway --version**.

<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@archwayhq/cli?activeTab=versions" target="_blank" >See all availble versions of @archwayhq/cli</a>

## Archway Developer CLI

Install the Archway developer CLI using  <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm" target="_blank" >npm</a>.
::highlight-card

```bash
npm install -g @archwayhq/cli
```

::
::alert{variant="info"}
If you are running **archwayd** using <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker" target="_blank" >Docker</a>, and not running in <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/" target="_blank" >Rootless Mode</a>, you may need to install the Archway developer CLI as `root`, or give yourself permissions to the directory on your file system (for example,
`sudo chown YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_GROUPNAME -R ~/.archway`).
