# Installing development tools for Archway

To begin developing on the Archway Network, you'll need to set up several essential tools and dependencies. This guide will walk you through the installation process for each component, ensuring you have a robust development environment for creating, testing, and deploying smart contracts on the Archway blockchain.

## Prerequisites

- A Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS, or Windows Subsystem for Linux). If you are on `Windows` the following [guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) should help you with installing Windows Subsystem for Linux.
- Basic familiarity with command-line interfaces
- It is recommeded for `MacOs` users that they use `Homebrew` for installing packages where possible. Execute the following command to install `Homebrew`:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

If you are having issues installing Homebrew you can follow the instructions [here](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation).
- MacOs users require `Xcode CLI`. If you do not yet have this installed you can execute the following from your terminal to have it installed:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

## Dependencies

- [Openssl & pkg-config](#openssl-pkg-config 'Install Openssl & pkg-config')
- [Rust](#rust 'Install Rust')
- [Cargo](#cargo 'Install Cargo')
- [Cargo Generate](#cargo-generate 'Install Cargo Generate')
- [Node.js and NPM](#nodejs-and-npm 'Install Node.js and NPM')
- [Go](#go 'Install Go')
- [Archway Developer CLI](#archway-developer-cli 'Install develolper CLI')
- [Docker](#docker 'Install Docker')
- [Archwayd](#archwayd-optional 'Install Archway Daemon')

## Openssl & pkg-config

Certain Rust crates (libraries) used in CosmWasm development have dependencies that require `OpenSSL` and `pkg-config`. Here are the detailed steps for `macOS` and various `Linux` distributions:

#### macOS

1. **Install OpenSSL**:
   ```bash
   brew install openssl
   ```

2. **Install pkg-config**:
   ```bash
   brew install pkg-config
   ```

3. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - Open your shell profile file (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, or `~/.profile`) in a text editor and add the following line:

     ```bash
     export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/pkgconfig"
     ```

   - Source your profile file to apply the changes:

     ```bash
     source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bash_profile, depending on your shell
     ```

#### Linux

##### Debian-based distributions (e.g., Ubuntu)

1. **Update the package list**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. **Install OpenSSL**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install libssl-dev
   ```

3. **Install pkg-config**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install pkg-config
   ```

##### Red Hat-based distributions (e.g., Fedora)

1. **Install OpenSSL**:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install openssl-devel
   ```

2. **Install pkg-config**:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install pkgconf
   ```

##### Arch Linux

1. **Install OpenSSL and pkg-config**:
   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S openssl pkgconf
   ```

### Verify the Installation

To ensure that OpenSSL and `pkg-config` are installed correctly, run the following commands in your terminal:

1. **Check OpenSSL version**:

   ```bash
   openssl version
   ```

2. **Check pkg-config version**:

   ```bash
   pkg-config --version
   ```

## Rust

<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank" title="Rust Homepage">Rust</a> is the programming language used for smart contract development on Archway. The best way to install `Rust` on Unix-like operating systems is to use the `rustup` tool, which manages Rust installations and updates.

MacOS users can also install Rust via Homebrew. Run the following command in your Terminal:

```sh
brew install rust
```

The follow are steps to install `Rust` using `rustup` via any Unix-like operating system:

- In the Terminal, run the following command to download and install `rustup`:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

- You will be prompted to select an installation option. The recommendation is to use the default option by pressing `Enter`.

- Check if `Rust` and `rustup` were installed correctly by running the following commands:

```sh
rustc --version
cargo --version
rustup --version
```

The following is an example of the output:

```
rustc 1.82.0-nightly (c1a6199e9 2024-07-24)
note: if you need to support cargo 1.38 or earlier, you can symlink `config` to `config.toml`
cargo 1.82.0-nightly (5f6b9a922 2024-07-19)
rustup 1.27.1 (54dd3d00f 2024-04-24)
info: This is the version for the rustup toolchain manager, not the rustc compiler.
info: The currently active `rustc` version is `rustc 1.82.0-nightly (c1a6199e9 2024-07-24)`
```

If you are having issus installing Rust, follow the instructions for your operating system <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install" target="_blank" title="Install Rust">here</a>.

## Cargo

Cargo is the Rust package manager, like **go get** is for Golang or **npm** is for JavaScript. `Cargo` comes with `Rust` if you installed **Rust** using **rustup**.

If you did not already install **Rust** with **rustup**, or don't have **cargo** in your command line path, see the instructions for installing Cargo <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html" target="_blank" title="Install Rust">here</a>.

## Cargo generate & cargo run script

The **cargo-generate** tool creates a new Rust project quickly by leveraging a pre-existing code base. [Archway Developer CLI](#archway-developer-cli) uses **cargo-generate** and **cargo-run-script** to provide and manage project templates for dapp development.

To install <a href="https://cargo-generate.github.io/cargo-generate/installation.html#using-cargo-generate-with-vendored-openssl" target="_blank">cargo-generate</a> with **vendored-openssl**, and the **cargo-run-script** module, run the following commands in your terminal:

::highlight-card

```bash
cargo install cargo-generate --features vendored-openssl
cargo install cargo-run-script
```

::

## Node.js and npm

**Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript on your local machine, enabling the development of various applications and tools. **npm** (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for JavaScript that helps you install, update, and manage libraries and dependencies. The [Archway Developer CLI](#archway-developer-cli) relies on npm for installation and updates. Follow the instructions below to install **Node.js** and **npm** on your operating system.

## Archway Developer CLI

This tool is an `npm` package that offers a suite of commands to simplify interactions with the Archway blockchain. To install the Archway Developer CLI via `npm`, run the following command in your terminal:

::highlight-card

```bash
npm install -g @archwayhq/cli
```
::

::alert{variant="info"}
Since the release of [Archway CLI v2](/developers/developer-tools/developer-cli), **archwayd** is no longer a dependency for the Developer CLI. 
#title
Info
::

If you are on a Linux machine with a distribution different from Ubuntu, you may
need to install the [GNOME Keyring](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GNOME/Keyring),
or any other keyring compatible with the [Secret service API](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/auth/Secret-Service-API.html) to create accounts. Yuo can find more information on dependencies [here](https://github.com/archway-network/cli). 

## Archwayd

All the actions executable through **Archway Developer CLI** can also be performed via **archwayd**, but it requires significantly more knowledge to achieve the same results.

To install **archwayd**, you can either download the [latest release](https://github.com/archway-network/archway/releases) of the pre-built binary or build **archwayd** from [source](https://github.com/archway-network/archway#build-from-source). Ensure that you use the release corresponding to the version of **archwayd** being used on the chain where you will be deploying your contracts.

**Please note**: MacOs users with M2 chips might need to install from [source](https://github.com/archway-network/archway#build-from-source).

### Use pre-built binary

For Linux, and depending on your architecture:

::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
amd64

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
wget https://github.com/archway-network/archway/releases/download/$$archwayVersion$$/archwayd_linux_amd64
```

::

#title1
arm64

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
wget https://github.com/archway-network/archway/releases/download/$$archwayVersion$$/archwayd_linux_arm64

```

::

::

#### Verify the integrity of the binary

You can verify the binary by generating the sha256 hash of the downloaded file:

::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
amd64

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
sha256sum archwayd_linux_amd64
```

::

#title1
arm64

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
sha256sum archwayd_linux_arm64

```

::

::

Using the sha256sum command should generate a string (e.g., 4dd95ee0729b6593c9c390bde6e0c7bf3af0957d7f323e216b76ddb663fa7bc7). Next, you can download the sha256 checksum file corresponding to the release file using the command:

::highlight-card

```bash
wget archwaysha256.txt https://github.com/archway-network/archway/releases/download/$$archwayVersion$$/archwayd_$$archwayVersion$$_checksums.txt

```

::

Then you can compare the two sha256 hash strings to ensure they match. By doing so, you confirm that the downloaded file matches the official release file.

#### Add executable permissions

After downloading the file, you can add executable permissions to it using the **chmod** command:

::highlight-card

```bash
chmod +x archwayd_linux_amd64
```

::

The above command makes the binary executable.

#### Move the binary to the chosen directory

You can now move the binary to a directory in your PATH. The **/usr/local/bin directory** is commonly used for custom user programs not managed by the distribution package manager and is usually included in the **PATH**. You can move your file there with the **mv** command and also rename it to **archwayd** at the same time:

::highlight-card

```bash
sudo mv archwayd_linux_amd64 /usr/local/bin/archwayd
```

::

### Build from source

You will need to make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [make]() installed.

[Clone the repository](https://github.com/archway-network/archway), checkout the `main` branch and build:

```sh
cd archway
git checkout main
make install
```

This will install the `archwayd` binary to your `GOPATH`.
