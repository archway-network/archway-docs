# Installation

To get started developing on the Archway Network, you will need to have the the following dependencies installed.

## Required Dependencies

- [Rustc](#rustc 'Install Rust')
- [Cargo](#cargo 'Install Cargo')
- [Cargo Generate](#cargo-generate 'Install Cargo Generate')
- [wasm32](#wasm32 'Install wasm32')
- [Archwayd](#archwayd 'Install Archway Daemon')
- [Node.js](#nodejs-and-npm 'Install Node.js and NPM')
- [Archway Developer CLI](#archway-developer-cli 'Install develolper CLI')

#### Optional Dependencies

**IMPORTANT:** For local installations, you need root access to run `docker`. Make sure to follow all the steps with `root` access to prevent conflicts and confusions on the deployment process which requires root permission.

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker 'Install Docker') (for Linux users, it's recommended to [run the Docker daemon in Rootless Mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/))

## Rustc

`rustc`, provided by the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/ 'Rust Homepage') project maintainers, is the compiler for the Rust programming language. `rustc` takes your Rust source code and produces binary code as a library or an executable.

To install Rust, follow the instructions for your operating system at https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.

## Cargo

Cargo is the Rust package manager, like `go get` for Golang or `npm` is for JavaScript. Cargo comes with Rust if you installed `rustc` using `rustup`.

If you did not already install `rustc` with `rustup`, or don't have `cargo` in your command line path, see the instructions for installing Cargo at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html.

## Cargo Generate

The `cargo-generate` tool creates a new Rust project quickly by leveraging a pre-existing code base.

Archway uses `cargo-generate` and `cargo-run-script` to provide and manage project templates for dapp development.

To install `cargo-generate` with `vendored-openssl`, and the `cargo-run-script` module, run the commands:
::highlight-card

```bash
cargo install cargo-generate --features vendored-openssl
cargo install cargo-run-script
```

::

## wasm32

The `wasm32` [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) target is a 32-bit "bare wasm" module for producing [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) output that makes zero assumptions about your host machine and environment (hence the `-unknown-unkown` suffix). It's required by the [Developer CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@archwayhq/cli), as of version [`1.2.1`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@archwayhq/cli/v/1.2.1), for optimizing `wasm` output for on-chain storage of binaries.

Install `wasm32` using the following command:
::highlight-card

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

::

## Archwayd

`archwayd` is an implementation of a Cosmos zone with `wasm` smart contracts enabled.

Originally forked from the [cosmos/gaia repository](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia), `archwayd` adds new modules for developer rewards and for executing `wasm`, but otherwise the `archwayd` binary functions just like `gaiad`.

To build `archwayd`, install it from source or use the `archwaynetwork/archwayd` [Docker](https://www.docker.com/ 'Docker Homepage') container.

### Install Archwayd from Source

Get source code:
::highlight-card

```bash
git clone https://github.com/archway-network/archway.git
cd archway
```

::
Build and install:
::highlight-card

```bash
make install
```

::
::alert{variant="info"}
Building archwayd from source requires Go 1.17+

**NOTE**

::
::alert{variant="info"}
Docker is a required dependency of the [Developer CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@archwayhq/cli) for optimizing smart contracts for uploading to the blockchain via `rust-optimizer`
#title
**NOTE**
::

For full installation and configuration parameters, see https://github.com/archway-network/archway/blob/main/README.md.

### Install Archwayd Using Docker

Get source code:
::highlight-card

```bash
git clone https://github.com/archway-network/archway.git
cd archway
```

::
Build and install:
::highlight-card

```bash
docker build -t archway-network/archwayd:latest .
```

::
Or pull from Docker Hub:
::highlight-card

```
docker pull archwaynetwork/archwayd:latest
```

::

::alert{variant="success"}
To simplify using the Docker container, set an alias with the home path and the proper image tag (replacing `<network-name>`), like:
::highlight-card

```bash
alias archwayd="docker run --rm -it -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway archwaynetwork/archwayd:<network-name>"
```

::
After setting this alias, you can use the other `archwayd` commands without typing the verbose Docker run command.

Tip
::

For more information on running `archwayd` with the `archway-network/archwayd` [Docker](https://www.docker.com/ 'Docker Homepage') container, see https://github.com/archway-network/archway#dockerized.

## Node.js and Npm

`npm` is a package manager for JavaScript and Node.js. Archway uses `npm` for installing and updating the developer CLI.

For installing `node.js` and `npm`, see instructions for your operating system at https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm.

::alert{variant="info"}
`@archwayhq/cli` requires Node.js version 14 or higher, but some older versions in the `beta` release track required Node.js version 17. You can check which version you have installed using the command `archway --version`.

[See all availble versions of @archwayhq/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@archwayhq/cli?activeTab=versions)

## Archway Developer CLI

Install the Archway developer CLI using `npm`, see [Downloading and installing Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).
::highlight-card

```bash
npm install -g @archwayhq/cli
```

::
::alert{variant="error"}
**Note:** If you are running `archwayd` using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker), and not running in [Rootless Mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/), you may need to install the Archway developer CLI as `root`, or give yourself permissions to the directory on your file system (for example,
`sudo chown YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_GROUPNAME -R ~/.archway`).
