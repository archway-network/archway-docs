# Installation

To get started developing on the Archway Network, you will need to have the the following dependencies installed.

## Dependencies
### Required
- [Rustc](#rustc 'Install Rust')
- [Cargo](#cargo 'Install Cargo')
- [Cargo Generate](#cargo-generate 'Install Cargo Generate')
- [Node.js and NPM](#nodejs-and-npm 'Install Node.js and NPM')
- [Archway Developer CLI](#archway-developer-cli 'Install develolper CLI')
- <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker" target="_blank" >Docker</a>

### Optional
- [Archwayd](#archwayd 'Install Archway Daemon')

## Rustc

**rustc**, provided by the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank" title="Rust Homepage">Rust</a> project maintainers, is the compiler for the Rust programming language. **rustc** takes your Rust source code and produces binary code as a library or an executable.

To install Rust, follow the instructions for your operating system <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install" target="_blank" title="Install Rust">here</a>.

## Cargo

Cargo is the Rust package manager, like **go get** is for Golang or **npm** is for JavaScript. Cargo comes with Rust if you installed **rustc** using **rustup**.

If you did not already install **rustc** with **rustup**, or don't have **cargo** in your command line path, see the instructions for installing Cargo <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html" target="_blank" title="Install Rust">here</a>.

## Cargo Generate

The **cargo-generate** tool creates a new Rust project quickly by leveraging a pre-existing code base.

Archway Developer CLI uses **cargo-generate** and **cargo-run-script** to provide and manage project templates for dapp development.

To install <a href="https://cargo-generate.github.io/cargo-generate/installation.html#using-cargo-generate-with-vendored-openssl" target="_blank">cargo-generate</a> with **vendored-openssl**, and the **cargo-run-script** module, run the commands:
::highlight-card

```bash
cargo install cargo-generate --features vendored-openssl
cargo install cargo-run-script
```

::

## Node.js and npm

**npm** is a package manager for JavaScript and Node.js. It's required for installing and updating the Archway Developer CLI.

For installing **Node.js** and **npm**, see instructions for your operating system <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm" target="_blank">here</a>.

<!--::alert{variant="info"}
**@archwayhq/cli** requires Node.js version 14 or higher, but some older versions in the `beta` release track required Node.js version 17. You can check which version you have installed using the command **archway --version**.

<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@archwayhq/cli?activeTab=versions" target="_blank" >See all availble versions of @archwayhq/cli</a>

## Docker

<a href="https://docs.docker.com/" target="_blank" title="Install Docker">Docker</a> is required for the Archway Developer CLI to use the <a href="https://github.com/CosmWasm/rust-optimizer" target="_blank" >rust optimizer</a>. You can use <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/" target="_blank" title="Install Docker">Docker Desktop</a> or <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/" target="_blank" title="Install Docker">Docker Engine</a>.

::alert{variant="warning"}
For Linux users, it's recommended to run the Docker daemon in <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/" target="_blank"> **Rootless Mode**</a>
#title
Warning

## Archway Developer CLI

You can install the [Archway CLI](/developers/developer-tools/developer-cli) by using <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm" target="_blank" >npm</a>:

::highlight-card

```bash
npm install -g @archwayhq/cli
```
::

::alert{variant="info"}
Since the release of [Archway CLI v2](/developers/developer-tools/developer-cli), **archwayd** is no longer a dependency for the Developer CLI.

Info

## Archwayd (optional)

All the actions executable through **Archway Developer CLI** can also be performed via **archwayd**, but it requires significantly more knowledge to achieve the same results.

To install **archwayd**, you can either download the [latest release](https://github.com/archway-network/archway/releases) of the pre-built binary or build **archwayd** from [source](https://github.com/archway-network/archway#build-from-source). Ensure that you use the release corresponding to the version of **archwayd** being used on the chain where you will be deploying your contracts.

For Linux, and depending on your architecture:

::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
amd64

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
wget https://github.com/archway-network/archway/releases/download/$$archwayVersion$$/archwayd_linux_amd64
```

::

#title1
arm64

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
wget https://github.com/archway-network/archway/releases/download/$$archwayVersion$$/archwayd_linux_arm64

```

::

::

### Verify the integrity of the binary

You can verify the binary by generating the sha256 hash of the downloaded file:

::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
amd64

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
sha256sum archwayd_linux_amd64
```

::

#title1
arm64

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
sha256sum archwayd_linux_arm64

```

::

::

Using the sha256sum command should generate a string (e.g., 4dd95ee0729b6593c9c390bde6e0c7bf3af0957d7f323e216b76ddb663fa7bc7). Next, you can download the sha256 checksum file corresponding to the release file using the command:

::highlight-card

```bash
wget archwaysha256.txt https://github.com/archway-network/archway/releases/download/$$archwayVersion$$/archwayd_$$archwayVersion$$_checksums.txt

```

::

Then you can compare the two sha256 hash strings to ensure they match. By doing so, you confirm that the downloaded file matches the official release file.

### Add executable permissions

After downloading the file, you can add executable permissions to it using the **chmod** command:

::highlight-card

```bash
chmod +x archwayd_linux_amd64
```

::

The above command makes the binary executable.

### Move the binary to the chosen directory

You can now move the binary to a directory in your PATH. The **/usr/local/bin directory** is commonly used for custom user programs not managed by the distribution package manager and is usually included in the **PATH**. You can move your file there with the **mv** command and also rename it to **archwayd** at the same time:

::highlight-card

```bash
sudo mv archwayd_linux_amd64 /usr/local/bin/archwayd
```
