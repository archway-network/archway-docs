# How cw key value storage works?

As mentioned before, the storage in Cosmos-SDK is based on a key-value store, where each value is saved under a key. The storage is structured using a tree model, specifically, the <a href="https://github.com/cosmos/iavl" target="_blank">cosmos/iavl</a> tree structure.

Here is an explanation of how key-value storage works:

![AVL Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree#/media/File:AVL-tree-wBalance_K.svg)
*This is a very simplified explanation to help you understand KV store iterators.*

Letter inside circles are keys, and each key corresponds to a value.

Let's assume these are the saved key value pairs:

- `J` -> value1
- `JF` -> value2
- `JPV` -> value3
- `JPVA` -> value4
- `JPVD` -> value5
- `JPVX` -> value6

Retrieving a single value with a known key is a cheap operation, taking only O(1) time. But what if you need to iterate over keys? In this case, iteration can be done via prefixes.

- `J` key, prefixes: `J`
- `JF` key, prefixes: `J`, `JF`
- `JPV` key, prefixes: `J`,`JP`, `JPV`
- `JPVA` key, prefixes: `J`,`JP`, `JPV`, `JPVA`
- `JPVD` key, prefixes: `J`,`JP`, `JPV`, `JPVD`
- `JPVX` key, prefixes: `J`,`JP`, `JPV`, `JPVX`

range(`J`) returns all keys because all have `J` as prefix
range(`JF`) returns only `JF`

This is where it gets interesting:
range(`JPV`) returns `JPV`, `JPVA`, `JPVD`, `JPVX` in order
As you can see `J` or `JF` is not returned, because values after `JPV` is requested.

But why `JPVA` returned?

Keys are saved to storage as fixed-length strings. For example, the representation of `JPVA` in storage (assuming keys are 8 characters long) would be `JPVA0000`. When a range request is made, the background process iterates over all keys from `JPV00000` to `JPVFFFFF`, and `JPVA` (along with other keys) falls into this range. Additionally, a range query can be run in reverse.

These are the only two functionalities there are: get single value, iterate.

Most of the time complex relations between data structures must be established, but all we have this limited key value
storage.

This is done by building [indexes](/developers/cosmwasm-documentation/tutorials/storage/indexes).
