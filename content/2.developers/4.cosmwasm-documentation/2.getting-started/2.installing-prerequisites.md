# Installing prerequisites

We have put together an [Installation](/developers/getting-started/install) guide to help you set up all the necessary software for developing CosmWasm smart contracts on the Archway network.

## Setting up your IDE
A reliable IDE is essential for developing smart contracts using Rust. <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code (VSCode)</a> is a highly popular IDE for software development. For more information on setting up VSCode for CosmWasm development, see the [Integrated Development Environment Setup guide](/developers/getting-started/ide-setup).
