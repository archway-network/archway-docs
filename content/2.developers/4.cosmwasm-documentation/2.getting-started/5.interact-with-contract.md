# Deployment and interaction

You now have the wasm binary ready. It's time to deploy it to the Archway (Constantine) testnet and begin interacting with your smart contract. You can use the [archwayd CLI](#archwayd-cli), [Archway Developer CLI](#archway-developer-cli), or the [arch3.js](#arch3js), depending on your preference.

## Deploy contract

In the [Compile Contract](/developers/cosmwasm-documentation/getting-started/compile-contract) page, we generated a wasm binary executable. You can upload the code to the blockchain, and once the process is complete, you can download the bytecode for verification purposes.

### Deploy using archwayd

Now you will store the wasm bytecode of the `cw_namespace` contract on chain and obtain the `code id`. This `code id` will be used later to create an instance of the `cw_namespace` contract.

Change `mywallet` to the name of the the wallet you created in the [Setting up environment](/developers/cosmwasm-documentation/getting-started/setting-up-environment) page. Execute the following commands to store the contract on chain:

```shell
RES=$(archwayd tx wasm store artifacts/cw_nameservice.wasm --from mywallet --node https://rpc.constantine-1.archway.tech:443 --chain-id constantine-1 --gas-prices 0.25uconst --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.3 -y --output json -b block)

# The response contains the Code Id of the uploaded wasm binary
echo $RES

# The following is an easier way to get the Code Id from the response
CODE_ID=$(echo $RES | jq -r '.logs[0].events[] | select(.type=="store_code") | .attributes[] | select(.key=="code_id") | .value')
echo $CODE_ID
```

You can see the list of contracts instantiated using the Code Id generated above by executing the following command:

```shell
archwayd query wasm list-contract-by-code $CODE_ID --node https://rpc.constantine-1.archway.tech:443 --output json
```

The response should be an empty list since no contracts have been instantiated yet.

```json
{"contracts":[],"pagination":{"next_key":null,"total":"0"}}
```

Before you instantiate a contract using the Code Id and interact with it, let's verify if the code stored on the blockchain is indeed the `cw_namespace.wasm` binary you uploaded.

```shell
# Download the wasm binary from the chain and compare it to the original one
archwayd query wasm code $CODE_ID --node https://rpc.constantine-1.archway.tech:443 download.wasm

# The two binaries should be identical
diff artifacts/cw_nameservice.wasm download.wasm
```

If the `diff` command yields an empty output, this indicates that the two files being compared are identical.

### Deploy using archway developer cli

If your contract was created using the `archway new` command, you can deploy the contract using the following command:

```shell
archway store
```

For details on how to create a CosmWasm project with the `Archway Developer CLI`, see [Creating a project](/developers/getting-started/setup#creating-a-project).

## Instantiating the contract
You can now create an instance of the wasm contract. After instantiation, you can make queries and execute transactions.

### Instantiate using archwayd

```shell
# Prepare the instantiation message
INIT='{"purchase_price":{"amount":"100","denom":"uconst"},"transfer_price":{"amount":"999","denom":"uconst"}}'

# Instantiate the contract
archwayd tx wasm instantiate $CODE_ID "$INIT" --from mywallet --label "name service" --node https://rpc.constantine-1.archway.tech:443 --chain-id constantine-1 --gas-prices 0.25uconst --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.3 -y --no-admin

# Check the contract details and account balance
archwayd query wasm list-contract-by-code $CODE_ID --node https://rpc.constantine-1.archway.tech:443 --output json

CONTRACT=$(archwayd query wasm list-contract-by-code $CODE_ID --node https://rpc.constantine-1.archway.tech:443 --output json | jq -r '.contracts[-1]')

echo $CONTRACT

# See the contract details
archwayd query wasm contract $CONTRACT --node https://rpc.constantine-1.archway.tech:443

# Check the contract balance
archwayd query bank balances $CONTRACT --node https://rpc.constantine-1.archway.tech:443

# Upon instantiation the cw_nameservice contract will store the instatiation message data in the contract's storage with the storage key "config".
# Query the entire contract state
archwayd query wasm contract-state all $CONTRACT --node https://rpc.constantine-1.archway.tech:443
```

## Contract Interaction
Now that the contract is instantiated, you can register a name and transfer it to another address by paying the transfer fee.

### Interact using archwayd

```shell
# Register a name for the wallet address
REGISTER='{"register":{"name":"fred"}}'
archwayd tx wasm execute $CONTRACT "$REGISTER" --amount 100uconst --from mywallet --node https://rpc.constantine-1.archway.tech:443 --chain-id constantine-1 --gas-prices 0.25uconst --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.3 -y

# Query the owner of the name record
NAME_QUERY='{"resolve_record": {"name": "fred"}}'
archwayd query wasm contract-state smart $CONTRACT "$NAME_QUERY" --node https://rpc.constantine-1.archway.tech:443 --output json
# {"data":{"address":"archway1hlsd2tgjxalap5gslxz4g4t0f0yr9nwne98uyu"}}

# Transfer the ownership of the name record to wallet2 (change the "to" address to wallet2 address generated during environment setup)
archwayd keys list
TRANSFER='{"transfer":{"name":"fred","to":"archway1htum43he4n46gdmvuzr72ahsyvau4ummdgeytv"}}'
archwayd tx wasm execute $CONTRACT "$TRANSFER" --amount 999uconst --from mywallet --node https://rpc.constantine-1.archway.tech:443 --chain-id constantine-1 --gas-prices 0.25uconst --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.3 -y

# Query the record owner again to see the new owner address:
NAME_QUERY='{"resolve_record": {"name": "fred"}}'
archwayd query wasm contract-state smart $CONTRACT "$NAME_QUERY" --node https://rpc.constantine-1.archway.tech:443 --output json
# {"data":{"address":"archway1htum43he4n46gdmvuzr72ahsyvau4ummdgeytv"}}
```
