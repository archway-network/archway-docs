# Next steps

This was a very simple example of the name service contract that has been developed, but it should show you what is possible, limited only by the WebAssembly (Wasm) code you upload and the JSON messages you send. Here are some next steps to further explore and learn about CosmWasm:

- <a href="https://area-52.io/" target="_blank">Area-52</a>: An excellent tutorial series focused on CosmWasm smart contract development.
- <a href="https://github.com/InterWasm/cw-awesome" target="_blank">cw-awesome</a>: A curated collection of CosmWasm resources.
- <a href="https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-template" target="_blank">cw-template</a>: A CosmWasm starter project. Instead of cloning the repository, follow the README to learn how to use cargo-generate for generating your project skeleton.
- <a href="https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus" target="_blank">cw-plus</a>: Production-grade smart contracts designed to secure billions, actively maintained and developed by Confio. High-quality, community-made smart contracts are hosted here.
- <a href="https://github.com/InterWasm/cw-contracts" target="_blank">cw-contracts</a>: A repository of community-made smart contracts. Contributions are welcome.
