# Compiling a contract

In this section, we will download the code for a sample contract and compile it into a wasm binary executable.

## Prerequisites

Please refer to the [Setting up environment](/developers/cosmwasm-documentation/getting-started/setting-up-environment) guide to install the required dependencies before proceeding.

## Download contract

Begin by downloading the <a href="https://github.com/InterWasm/cw-contracts" target="_blank">cw-contracts</a> repository. You will be compiling the **nameservice** contract.

Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/InterWasm/cw-contracts
cd cw-contracts
git checkout main
cd contracts/nameservice
```

## Compile contract using rust-optimizer

::alert{variant="info"}
You will need [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed and running in order to run **rust-optimizer**.

Info
::

Navigate to the project root and run the following command:

```shell
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/code \
  --mount type=volume,source="$(basename "$(pwd)")_cache",target=/code/target \
  --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
  cosmwasm/rust-optimizer:0.12.12
```

On Windows, you can run the following command instead from the root of your smart contract's project folder.

```powershell
docker run --rm -v ${pwd}:/code `
 --mount type=volume,source="$("$(Split-Path -Path $pwd -Leaf)")_cache",target=/code/target `
 --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry `
 cosmwasm/rust-optimizer:0.12.12
```

This command will optimize the **.wasm** file and generate an optimized **.wasm** file in the **artifacts** directory.
