# Result and option
In Rust, **Result** and **Option** are enum types, which means they contain values within their variants:

```rust
enum Option<T> {
  Some(T),
  // existence
  None, // non-existence
}

enum Result<T, E> {
  Ok(T),
  // success
  Err(E), // failure
}
```
## Result
Result is an enum type, **Result<T, E>**, where both **T** and **E** are generics, representing success and failure. **Result** types are often used in entry points and handlers:

- **Ok(T)** : a Result container which has succeeded, containing **T**
- **Err(E)** : a Result container which has failed, containing **E**

Many contract entry points are typed **Result<Response, ContractError>**, where **Response** is the Right or Success branch, while **ContractError** is the Left or failure case. For example, looking at the <a href="https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus/blob/main/contracts/cw20-base/src/contract.rs" target="_blank">CW20-base</a> we can see that **execute** is typed **Result<Response, ContractError>**, and the function call that matches **ExecuteMsg::Transfer** would be **execute_transfer** which shows how the result is returned:

```rust
pub fn execute_transfer(
  deps: DepsMut,
  _env: Env,
  info: MessageInfo,
  recipient: String,
  amount: Uint128,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
  if amount == Uint128::zero() {
    return Err(ContractError::InvalidZeroAmount {});
  }

  let rcpt_addr = deps.api.addr_validate(&recipient)?;

  BALANCES.update(
    deps.storage,
    &info.sender,
    |balance: Option<Uint128>| -> StdResult<_> {
      Ok(balance.unwrap_or_default().checked_sub(amount)?)
    },
  )?;
  BALANCES.update(
    deps.storage,
    &rcpt_addr,
    |balance: Option<Uint128>| -> StdResult<_> { Ok(balance.unwrap_or_default() + amount) },
  )?;

  let res = Response::new()
    .add_attribute("action", "transfer")
    .add_attribute("from", info.sender)
    .add_attribute("to", recipient)
    .add_attribute("amount", amount);
  Ok(res)
}
```

## StdResult
It is also important to be mindful of **StdResult**, as it is frequently utilized in query handlers and the functions invoked by them.

For instance, in the nameservice contract, you can observe the **StdResult**, which functions similarly to **Result**, but lacks a specified error branch:

```rust
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn query(deps: Deps, env: Env, msg: QueryMsg) -> StdResult<Binary> {
  match msg {
    QueryMsg::ResolveRecord { name } => query_resolver(deps, env, name),
    QueryMsg::Config {} => to_binary(&config_read(deps.storage).load()?),
  }
}
```

Let's see the implementation of **query_resolver**:

```rust
fn query_resolver(deps: Deps, _env: Env, name: String) -> StdResult<Binary> {
  let key = name.as_bytes();

  let address = match resolver_read(deps.storage).may_load(key)? {
    Some(record) => Some(String::from(&record.owner)),
    None => None,
  };
  let resp = ResolveRecordResponse { address };

  to_binary(&resp)
}
```

It is essential to match or unwrap your container types accurately, enabling you to work with the values contained within them.

## Option
In Rust, there is no concept of **nil** or **null**, unlike in most other mainstream programming languages. Instead, Rust employs the **Option** type, which encapsulates the notion of presence or absence within a container type.

**Option<T>** is an enum type, with two variants:

- **Some(<wrapped-value>)**: Wraps an inner value, which can be accessed via **.unwrap()**.
-**None**: Represents the absence of a value and is often used as a default or placeholder value when a value is not yet known or cannot be determined.


The following code snippet is an example of how Rust's **Option<T>** can be used to allow for optional values of **purchase_price** and **transfer_price**:

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
pub struct InstantiateMsg {
  pub purchase_price: Option<Coin>,
  pub transfer_price: Option<Coin>,
}
```

For instances of the **InstantiateMsg** above, there will either be a result, or nothing. To handle this scenario, it is common to use the match operator to pattern match the two cases:

```rust
let address = match resolver_read(deps.storage).may_load(key)? {
  Some(record) => Some(String::from( & record.owner)),
  None => None,
};
```

If returning **None** would indicate an error state, it is conventionally recommended to throw an error instead of handling the None value.
