# Messages

The interaction with a CosmWasm smart contract is facilitated through messages. Within most contracts, you will find a **msg.rs** file that outlines these messages.

The **instantiate** message, for example, is used to create a new instance of a CosmWasm smart contract on the blockchain. This message is typically defined in **msg.rs** as **InstantiateMsg** and is then passed to an **instantiate** function in the main **contract.rs** for processing.

The examples used here are very simple. However, if you are confused about the arguments that can be passed, you can look in the contract's **schema** folder. There, you will find at least two relevant files:

- **instantiate_msg.json** - The expected shape and types for the instantiate message
- **execute_msg.json** - The expected shape and types for each of the messages that the contract can use to execute an action

Some contracts with large APIs may have many more schema files. Explore them to find the message or command you're looking for.

In the **nameservice** example contract, there are only two valid messages once the contract has been instantiated:

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub enum ExecuteMsg {
  Register { name: String },
  Transfer { name: String, to: String },
}
```

The context of this code can be found <a href="https://github.com/InterWasm/cw-contracts/blob/main/contracts/nameservice/src/msg.rs#L13" target="_blank">here</a>.

The **ExecuteMsg** message can then be processed within **contract.rs**. Each of the **enum** values can then be handled in the **execute** function as follows:

```rust
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn execute(
  deps: DepsMut,
  env: Env,
  info: MessageInfo,
  msg: ExecuteMsg,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
  match msg {
    ExecuteMsg::Register { name } => execute_register(deps, env, info, name),
    ExecuteMsg::Transfer { name, to } => execute_transfer(deps, env, info, name, to),
  }
}
```

Here you can find the source code for the <a href="https://github.com/InterWasm/cw-contracts/blob/main/contracts/nameservice/src/contract.rs#L31" target="_blank">execute function</a>.
