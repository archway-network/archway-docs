# Query

Querying is a process used for extracting data from a database or accessing state information. Typically, the available query messages can be found in either `msg.rs` or `query.rs`, depending on the organization of the code by the contract author.

You can perform queries using an external client (such as an API or through the CLI) or within a contract. For more information on how this works, see [Querying contract state](/developers/cosmwasm-documentation/architecture/querying).

Queries access the data store of a contract in read-only mode. They can retrieve data and perform additional processing as needed. Consequently, a gas limit is imposed.

Queries consist of an entry in the <a href="https://github.com/InterWasm/cw-contracts/blob/main/contracts/nameservice/src/msg.rs#L20" target="_blank">QueryMsg</a> enum and are managed within the contract's `query` function.

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub enum QueryMsg {
  // ResolveAddress returns the current address that the name resolves to
  ResolveRecord { name: String },
  Config {},
}
```

The contract then processes this in the <a href="https://github.com/InterWasm/cw-contracts/blob/main/contracts/nameservice/src/contract.rs#L95" target="_blank">query function</a>:

```rust
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn query(deps: Deps, env: Env, msg: QueryMsg) -> StdResult<Binary> {
  match msg {
    QueryMsg::ResolveRecord { name } => query_resolver(deps, env, name),
    QueryMsg::Config {} => to_binary(&config_read(deps.storage).load()?),
  }
}
```

Here, `query_resolver` is merely another function, and `config_read` is a helper that encapsulates access to the data store.
