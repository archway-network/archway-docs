# Math
The math functions utilized by CosmWasm are based on standard Rust, but helper functions are provided for `u128`, `u64`, and `decimals`.

## Uint128
A lightweight `u128` wrapper utilizing string-based JSON encoding/decoding, enabling the complete `u128` range for clients that process JSON numbers as floats, such as JavaScript and jq.

## Uint64
A thin layer encompassing `u64`, which employs strings for JSON encoding and decoding, allowing the complete `u64` range to be utilized by clients that change JSON numbers to floats, such as JavaScript and jq.

## Decimal
A fixed-point decimal value featuring 18 fractional digits; for example, `Decimal(1_000_000_000_000_000_000) == 1.0`. The largest possible value that can be represented is `340282366920938463463.374607431768211455` (equivalent to (2^128 - 1) / 10^18).
