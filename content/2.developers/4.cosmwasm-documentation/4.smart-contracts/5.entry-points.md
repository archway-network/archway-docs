# Entry points
In CosmWasm, entry points enable contracts to process messages and queries.

The primary handlers consist of:

- **Instantiate:** This handles instantiation messages as defined by the `InstantiateMsg` struct.
- **Execute:** This manages messages as defined by the `ExecuteMsg` enum, utilizing a pattern-matching statement.
- **Query:** This addresses queries as defined by the `QueryMsg` enum, using pattern matching.

The `execute` and `query` functions must match every variant in the enums they handle, while the `instantiate` function only needs to handle the struct it receives.

Typically, `instantiate` and `execute` have the type `Result<Response, ContractError>`, while `query` has the type `StdResult<Binary>` due to the underlying Cosmos SDK Querier.

As you can see from the code snippet below, these handlers are explicitly marked as entry points and are excluded from being bundled in the library:

```rust
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn instantiate(
  deps: DepsMut,
  _env: Env,
  _info: MessageInfo,
  msg: InstantiateMsg,
) -> Result<Response, StdError> {
  // ...etc
}
```
