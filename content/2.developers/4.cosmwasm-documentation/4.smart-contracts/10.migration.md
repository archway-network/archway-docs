# Migration

Migration refers to the process of updating or replacing the code of an existing smart contract, and in some cases, the modification of state data.

CosmWasm has made contract migration a seamless experience. During contract instantiation, there's an optional **admin** field that can be set. If this field is not specified, the contract becomes immutable. However, if it's assigned to an external account or governance contract, that account can initiate the migration. The admin can also transfer ownership to another account or make the contract completely immutable after some time by setting the admin field to an empty value.

This is where the CW2 specification comes into play. It specifies a special **Singleton** that contains the contract's name and version information to be stored by all CW2-compliant contracts during instantiation. When the migration function is invoked, the newly created contract can access this information to determine if it is compatible with migrating from the previous contract.

The CW2 Specification provides a **set_contract_version** function that should be utilized when instantiating a new contract through the **instantiate** function to store the contract's versioning information. For the migrating contract, it is important to use the **set_contract_version** function as part of the migration logic within the **migrate(...)** function, rather than the **instantiate** function, to update the contract versioning during the migration process:

```rust
const CONTRACT_NAME: &str = env!("CARGO_PKG_NAME");
const CONTRACT_VERSION: &str = env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION");


#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn instantiate(deps: DepsMut, env: Env, info: MessageInfo, msg: InstantiateMsg) -> Response {
    // Use CW2 to set the contract version, this is needed for migrations
    set_contract_version(deps.storage, CONTRACT_NAME, CONTRACT_VERSION)?;
}
```

For the migrating contract, in addition to using **set_contract_version**, you can also utilize the **get_contract_version** function to determine the previous version of the contract. It is important to ensure, for example, that the update is only performed if the version being upgraded is later than the original contract version:

```rust
use semver::Version;

// Migrate contract if version is lower than current version
#[entry_point]
pub fn migrate(deps: DepsMut, _env: Env, _msg: Empty) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    let version: Version = CONTRACT_VERSION.parse()?;
    let storage_version: Version = get_contract_version(deps.storage)?.version.parse()?;

    if storage_version < version {
        set_contract_version(deps.storage, CONTRACT_NAME, CONTRACT_VERSION)?;

        // If state structure changed in any contract version in the way migration is needed, it
        // should occur here
    }

    Ok(Response::new())
}
```

Both the **set_contract_version** and **get_contract_version** methods operate on an **Item** data structure from **cw_storage_plus**, which manages this information:

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, PartialEq, JsonSchema, Debug)]
pub struct ContractVersion {
    /// contract is a globally unique identifier for the contract.
    /// it should build off standard namespacing for whichever language it is in,
    /// and prefix it with the registry we use.
    /// For rust we prefix with `crates.io:`, to give us eg. `crates.io:cw20-base`
    pub contract: String,
    /// version is any string that this implementation knows. It may be simple counter "1", "2".
    /// or semantic version on release tags "v0.7.0", or some custom feature flag list.
    /// the only code that needs to understand the version parsing is code that knows how to
    /// migrate from the given contract (and is tied to it's implementation somehow)
    pub version: String,
}
```

Thus, a serialized example may appear as follows:

```json
{
    "contract": "crates.io:cw20-base",
    "version": "v0.1.0"
}
```

## Setting up a contract for migrations

Performing a contract migration involves three steps. Firstly, write a newer version of the contract you wish to update. Secondly, store the new code on chain, but don't instantiate it. Thirdly, utilize a dedicated [MsgMigrateContract](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd/blob/v0.32.0/proto/cosmwasm/wasm/v1/tx.proto#L139-L148) transaction to point the old contract towards the new code, and the migration is complete. See [Execute a migrate transaction](/developers/cosmwasm-documentation/smart-contracts/migration#execute-a-migrate-transaction) below on how to execute a migration transaction using either **archwayd** or **arch3.js**.

During the migration process, the **migrate** function defined in the new contract is executed and not the **migrate** function from the old code and therefore it is necessary for the new contract code to have a **migrate** function defined and properly exported as an **entry_point**: 

```rust
use cosmwasm_std::{
    Empty, Env, DepsMut, Response,
};
use crate::error::ContractError;

#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn migrate(deps: DepsMut, _env: Env, _msg: Empty) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {

}
```

The **migrate** function provides the ability to make any desired granular changes to the **State**, similar to a database migration.

If the **migrate** function returns an error, the transaction will abort, all State changes will be reverted, and the migration will not be carried out.

Below are several migration variations to give an idea of some common use cases.

### Basic contract migration

This migration might be the most frequently encountered. It merely replaces the code of a contract. However, safety checks are not implemented as there is no **cw2::set_contract_version** check being done.

```rust
use cosmwasm_std::{ Empty, Env, DepsMut, Response };
use crate::error::ContractError;
use crate::msg::{ MigrateMsg };

const CONTRACT_NAME: &str = env!("CARGO_PKG_NAME");
const CONTRACT_VERSION: &str = env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION");

#[entry_point]
pub fn migrate(deps: DepsMut, _env: Env, msg: MigrateMsg) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    // No state migrations performed, just returned a Response
    Ok(Response::default())
}
```

### Migration by code version and contract name

This migration is a more comprehensive example. The migrate function ensures:

- Migrating from the same type of contract by verifying its name
- Upgrading from an older version of the contract by checking its version

```rust
const CONTRACT_NAME: &str = env!("CARGO_PKG_NAME");
const CONTRACT_VERSION: &str = env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION");

#[entry_point]
pub fn migrate(deps: DepsMut, _env: Env, msg: MigrateMsg) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    let ver = cw2::get_contract_version(deps.storage)?;
    // ensure we are migrating from a compatible contract
    if ver.contract != CONTRACT_NAME {
        return Err(StdError::generic_err("Can only upgrade from same contract type").into());
    }
    // note: it's better to do a proper semver comparison, but a string comparison *usually* works
    #[allow(clippy::cmp_owned)]
    if ver.version >= CONTRACT_VERSION {
        return Err(StdError::generic_err("Cannot upgrade from a newer contract version").into());
    }

    // set the new version
    cw2::set_contract_version(deps.storage, CONTRACT_NAME, CONTRACT_VERSION)?;

    // do any required state migrations...

    Ok(Response::default())
}
```

### Migrate using semver comparison

This migration uses Semver instead of a String comparison.

```rust
const CONTRACT_NAME: &str = env!("CARGO_PKG_NAME");
const CONTRACT_VERSION: &str = env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION");

#[entry_point]
pub fn migrate(deps: DepsMut, _env: Env, msg: MigrateMsg) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    let version: Version = CONTRACT_VERSION.parse()?;
    let storage_version: Version = get_contract_version(deps.storage)?.version.parse()?;

    if storage_version < version {
        set_contract_version(deps.storage, CONTRACT_NAME, CONTRACT_VERSION)?;

        // If state structure changed in any contract version in the way migration is needed, it
        // should occur here
    }
    Ok(Response::default())
}
```

This example uses **Semver** to help with version checks. You would also need to add the semver dependency to your cargo dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies]
semver = "1"
```

You can also implement Semver custom errors:

```rust
#[derive(Error, Debug, PartialEq)]
pub enum ContractError {

    #[error("Semver parsing error: {0}")]
    SemVer(String),

}
impl From<semver::Error> for ContractError {
    fn from(err: semver::Error) -> Self {
        Self::SemVer(err.to_string())
    }
}
```

### Using migrate to update otherwise immutable state

This example demonstrates how a migration can be used to update a value that is typically immutable. This feature allows for changing the value only during a migration if necessary.

```rust
#[entry_point]
pub fn migrate(deps: DepsMut, _env: Env, msg: MigrateMsg) -> Result<Response, HackError> {
    let data = deps
        .storage
        .get(CONFIG_KEY)
        .ok_or_else(|| StdError::not_found("State"))?;
    let mut config: State = from_slice(&data)?;
    config.verifier = deps.api.addr_validate(&msg.verifier)?;
    deps.storage.set(CONFIG_KEY, &to_vec(&config)?);

    Ok(Response::default())
}
```

In the above example, our **MigrateMsg** has a **verifier** field which contains the new value for our contract's **verifier** field located in the State. Provided your contract does not also expose an **UpdateState** or something like **UpdateVerifier** ExecuteMsgs, then this provides the only method to change the **verifier** value.

### Using migrations to 'burn' a contract

Migrations can also be used to abandon an old contract and erase its state. This has various applications, but if needed, an example can be found [here](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/blob/main/contracts/burner/src/contract.rs#L20):

```rust
#[entry_point]
pub fn migrate(deps: DepsMut, env: Env, msg: MigrateMsg) -> StdResult<Response> {
    // delete all state
    let keys: Vec<_> = deps
        .storage
        .range(None, None, Order::Ascending)
        .map(|(k, _)| k)
        .collect();
    let count = keys.len();
    for k in keys {
        deps.storage.remove(&k);
    }

    // get balance and send all to recipient
    let balance = deps.querier.query_all_balances(env.contract.address)?;
    let send = BankMsg::Send {
        to_address: msg.payout.clone(),
        amount: balance,
    };

    let data_msg = format!("burnt {} keys", count).into_bytes();

    Ok(Response::new()
        .add_message(send)
        .add_attribute("action", "burn")
        .add_attribute("payout", msg.payout)
        .set_data(data_msg))
}

```

In the above example, the state is completely deleted during the migration. Also, all the contract's balance is sent to a designated **payout** address specified in the **MigrationMsg**. As a result, all funds are drained and all state is removed, effectively burning the contract.

## Create a mutable contract

In CosmWasm, a mutable contract refers to a smart contract that allows for the modification of its state and code after deployment. By default, CosmWasm contracts are immutable, meaning that their state cannot be changed once they are deployed on the blockchain. However, if the contract is **instantiated** with an admin address, that account can execute a migration to update the contract's code and state.

### Create a mutable contract via archway developer CLI

```bash
archway instantiate --admin-address <value>  -a <arg value>
```

Substitute **\<value\>** with the address that will serve as the admin address of the contract. Only this address can execute a contract migration. If the contract requires arguments you would substitute the **\<arg value\>** with a JSON object representing the argumnets.

### Create a mutable contract via archwayd

```bash
archwayd tx wasm migrate "archway1lr8rstt40s697hqpedv2nvt27f4cuccqwvly9gnvuszxmcevrlns60xw4r" 373 '{}' --from keplr --chain-id "constantine-3" --node "https://rpc.constantine.archway.tech:443" --broadcast-mode sync --output json -y --gas-prices $(archwayd q rewards estimate-fees 1 --node 'https://rpc.constantine.archway.tech:443' --output json | jq -r '.gas_unit_price | (.amount + .denom)')
```
