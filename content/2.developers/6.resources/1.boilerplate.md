# Boilerplate applications

This page will list a curated collection of boilerplate applications designed to kickstart your projects. These solutions should provide a solid foundation for building applications with efficiency and best practices in mind and bring your ideas to life faster.

## Cosmos kit and next.js

[Cosmos Kit](https://cosmoskit.com) is a wallet adapter for developers to build apps that quickly and easily interact with Cosmos blockchains and wallets and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) enables you to create full-stack Web applications by extending the latest React features.

The [cosmos-kit-nextjs14](https://github.com/time-bits/cosmos-kit-nextjs14) application brings both of these apps together into one boilerplate solution to streamline the creation of your project. This boilerplate is ideal for those looking to save time and effort in the early stages of development.

You can find a live demo from the latest build [here](https://cosmos-kit.vercel.app). View the [Readme](https://github.com/time-bits/cosmos-kit-nextjs14/blob/main/README.md#getting-started) file on the steps to get started.
