# Troubleshooting Development Issues

Here you'll find instructions for troubleshooting common issues and problems that can occur during Archway development.

- [General errors](#general-errors)
- [Creating project fails](#project-creation)
- [Deployment failures](#deployment-failures)
- [RPC errors](#rpc-errors)
- [Testing](#testing)
- [File permissions](#permissions-errors)
- [Miscellaneous](#miscellaneouss)

## General Errors

### Process exited with code 1 (ChildProcess)

There are times during development where you may receive unclear error messages from the developer CLI. This could be because the error message itself doesn't explain which part of the command has failed. These errors are usually triggered by Node's <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html" target="_blank">Child Process</a> module panicking and failing to complete a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise" target="_blank">Promise</a>.
::highlight-card

```bash
Failed to deploy project
Error: Process exited with code 1
at ChildProcess.done (/home/user/.nvm/versions/node/v17.9.0/lib/node_modules/@archwayhq/cli/node_modules/promisify-child-process/index.cjs:70:19)
at ChildProcess.emit (node:events:527:28)
at maybeClose (node:internal/child_process:1090:16)
at Process.ChildProcess._handle.onexit (node:internal/child_process:302:5)
```

::
To understand the real source of the error, you'll need to execute your command with some debugging flags enabled. To understand how to enable debugging on the developer CLI, review our [debugging instructions](debug).

### SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token

You'll get this error message for all Archway commands, if the NPM package for the developer CLI was installed using a legacy version of <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.js</a>. To solve this problem update Node.js and reinstall the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@archwayhq/cli" target="_blank">NPM package</a>. For information about which versions of Node.js are supported, review the [developer installation instructions](/developers/getting-started/install#nodejs-and-npm).

## Project Creation

### Error: no such subcommand

When creating a new project with the **archway new** command, if you encounter an error message stating **error: no such subcommand: run-script** or **error: no such subcommand: generate**, it means you're missing a required <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo" target="_blank">Cargo</a> package.

To resolve the issue, ensure that you've installed both **cargo-generate** and **cargo-run-script**.

Example:
::highlight-card

```bash
cargo install cargo-generate --features vendored-openssl
cargo install cargo-run-script
```

::

## Deployment Failures

### CosmWasm Rust optimizer fails

If you are having issues with the **cosmwasm/rust-optimizer**, you may need to update the Cargo.toml file at the root of your project with a different version of the optimizer.

Example (Old Cargo.toml):

```toml
[package.metadata.scripts]
optimize = """docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/code \
  -e CARGO_TERM_COLOR=always \
  --mount type=volume,source="$(basename "$(pwd)")_cache",target=/code/target \
  --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
  cosmwasm/rust-optimizer:0.12.5
"""
```

Example (Updated Cargo.toml):

```toml
[package.metadata.scripts]
optimize = """docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/code \
  -e CARGO_TERM_COLOR=always \
  --mount type=volume,source="$(basename "$(pwd)")_cache",target=/code/target \
  --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
  cosmwasm/rust-optimizer:0.12.6
"""
```

### Deployment stuck at downloading WASM

This could be an issue with the RPC node. If your deployment is continually getting stuck downloading **wasm**, try downloading it manually or use the flag **--no-verify** to skip checksum verification entirely.

To manually download and verify the **wasm** uploaded, you'll need to know the **code id** which you can get by searching the <a href="https://testnet.archway.explorers.guru" target="_blank">block explorer</a> for your upload transaction by its hash, or using the **archway history** command if your **config.json** was successfully updated after the transaction. Once you've got the **code id**, see below for an example of how to download and verify your **wasm** storage transaction.

Example:


::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
mainnet

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd query wasm code $YOUR_CODE_ID --node https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443 download.wasm
$ diff artifacts/YOUR_DOCKER_WASM_OUTPUT_FILE.wasm download.wasm
```

::

#title1
testnet

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd query wasm code $YOUR_CODE_ID --node "https://rpc.constantine.archway.io:443" download.wasm
$ diff artifacts/YOUR_DOCKER_WASM_OUTPUT_FILE.wasm download.wasm
```
::

::
### WASM stores but contract fails to instantiate

The most common reason for deployments failing during instantiation is incorrect arguments submitted to the **--args** flags. See [test passed but on-chain tx fails](#test-passed-but-on-chain-tx-fails) for more information.

## Testing

### Can't print data from tests

Ever wondered why you can't use macros like **println!** and **dbg!** to write to **stdout** from tests? This happens because Rust tests hide the **stdout** stream of successful tests to keep test output tidy. You can disable this behavior by passing the **--nocapture** option to the test binary or to cargo test (but, in this case after -- â€“ see below):

Examples:
::highlight-card

```bash
$ rustc --test main.rs; ./main

running 1 test
test test ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured

$ ./main --nocapture

running 1 test
Hidden output
test test ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

$ cargo test -- --nocapture

running 1 test
Hidden output
test test ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s
```

::
If you need to make this the default behavior of the **archway test** command, you can do so by modifying the value of **developer.scripts.test** in **config.json** at the root of your project.

Example:

Default JSON (excerpt)

```json
{
  "developer": {
    "scripts": {
      "test": "cargo unit-test",
      "build": "cargo build",
      "optimize": "cargo run-script optimize",
      "wasm": "cargo wasm",
      "query": "archwayd query wasm",
      "tx": "archwayd tx wasm execute"
    }
  }
}
```

Updated JSON (excerpt)

```json
{
  "developer": {
    "scripts": {
      "test": "cargo unit-test -- --nocapture",
      "build": "cargo build",
      "optimize": "cargo run-script optimize",
      "wasm": "cargo wasm",
      "query": "archwayd query wasm",
      "tx": "archwayd tx wasm execute"
    }
  }
}
```

### Test passed but on-chain tx fails

A frequent cause for this issue is an error in the arguments specified in the **--args** flag of the **archway deploy** or **archway tx** command.

There are several things to consider when constructing your JSON arguments for the **--args** flag. Below are a few use cases that will cause instantiation to fail.

**1) Invalid JSON**

If your arguments are not submitted in valid JSON format the instantiation will fail. The full error response looks like this:
::highlight-card

```bash
error: option '-a, --args <value>' argument '{count:0}' is invalid. Please inform a valid JSON string.
```

::
**2) Invalid JSON key**

If your JSON values are all correct, but one or more of their keys are not recognized, you'll get an **Error parsing into type** response from the developer CLI. The full error message might look like this:
::highlight-card

```bash
Error: rpc error: code = InvalidArgument desc = failed to execute message; message index: 0: Error parsing into type increment_project::msg::InstantiateMsg: missing field `count`: instantiate wasm contract failed: invalid request
```

::
**3) Invalid JSON value**

If the JSON keys are correct, but one or more values are not, you'll get an **Invalid type** error response from the developer CLI. The full error message looks like this:
::highlight-card

```bash
Error: rpc error: code = InvalidArgument desc = failed to execute message; message index: 0: Error parsing into type increment_project::msg::InstantiateMsg: Invalid type: instantiate wasm contract failed: invalid request
```

## RPC Errors

### My code used to work, I didn't change anything

This can happen if the RPC node you're connecting to is running a different version of **archwayd**.

If you are using the Docker version of **archwayd**, pull again from Docker Hub to get the latest image.

Example:
::highlight-card

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/archway-network/archwayd:$$archwayVersion$$
```

::
If you have installed **archwayd** locally from GitHub, you will need to pull the latest changes and reinstall **archwayd**.

Example:
::highlight-card

```bash
git fetch
git checkout tags/${tag_name} # e.g. git checkout tags/v0.0.5
make install
```

::

### InvalidArgument desc = account sequence mismatch

::highlight-card

```bash
Error: rpc error: code = InvalidArgument desc = account sequence mismatch, expected 13898, got 13884: incorrect account sequence: invalid request
```

::
The above error isn't caused by your code. It seems to occur during periods of high network activity. You can have a look at this <a href="https://github.com/archway-network/archway/issues/157" target="_blank">GitHub issue</a> for additional context.

We are actively looking for ways to solve it, but in the meantime your best bet is to continue broadcasting the transaction until it works. In some cases, you may also be able to get your transaction through by switching the **--broadcast-mode** flag sent to **archwayd**. The developer CLI currently defaults to **--broadcast-mode block**, to switch to **--broadcast-mode sync** you'll need to call **archwayd** directly.

Example (Instantiate):


::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
mainnet

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd tx wasm instantiate ${YOUR_CODE_ID} '{"key":"value"}' --from ${YOUR_WALLET_NAME} --label ${YOUR_DAPP_LABEL} --node https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443 --chain-id archway-1 --gas auto --gas-prices $(archwayd q rewards estimate-fees 1 --node 'https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443' --output json | jq -r '.gas_unit_price | (.amount + .denom)') --gas-adjustment 1.3 --broadcast-mode sync -y
```
::

#title1
testnet

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd tx wasm instantiate ${YOUR_CODE_ID} '{"key":"value"}' --from ${YOUR_WALLET_NAME} --label ${YOUR_DAPP_LABEL} --node https://rpc.constantine.archway.io:443 --chain-id constantine-3 --gas auto --gas-prices $(archwayd q rewards estimate-fees 1 --node 'https://rpc.constantine.archway.io:443' --output json | jq -r '.gas_unit_price | (.amount + .denom)') --gas-adjustment 1.3 --broadcast-mode sync -y
```

::

::






Example (Tx):


::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
mainnet

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd tx wasm execute ${YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS} '{"entrypoint":{}}' --from ${YOUR_WALLET_NAME} --node "https://rpc.constantine.archway.io:443" --chain-id archway-1 --gas auto --gas-prices $(archwayd q rewards estimate-fees 1 --node 'https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443' --output json | jq -r '.gas_unit_price | (.amount + .denom)') --gas-adjustment 1.3 --broadcast-mode sync -y
```

::

#title1
testnet

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd tx wasm execute ${YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS} '{"entrypoint":{}}' --from ${YOUR_WALLET_NAME} --node https://rpc.constantine.archway.io:443 --chain-id constantine-3 --gas auto --gas-prices $(archwayd q rewards estimate-fees 1 --node 'https://rpc.constantine.archway.io:443' --output json | jq -r '.gas_unit_price | (.amount + .denom)') --gas-adjustment 1.3 --broadcast-mode sync -y
```

## Permissions Errors

Docker setups are the source of most permissions errors, and by default Docker runs as the root user. If you're not running the Docker daemon in <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/" target="_blank">rootless mode</a> you may need to install the Archway developer CLI as root, or give your user permissions to the Archway directory on your filesystem.

Example:
::highlight-card

```bash
sudo chown YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_GROUPNAME -R ~/.archway
```

::
This problem can be avoided by installing **archwayd** locally. For those instructions see: [install archwayd from source](/developers/getting-started/install#install-archwayd-from-source)

## Miscellaneous

###  Providing flags to archwayd without passing them to docker

If you are running docker and want to pass flags to **archwayd** without having those flags being used by docker, you can	run docker in interactive mode: 

::highlight-card

```bash
docker run -it 
```

::

### Cannot find module â€˜fs/promisesâ€™


If you are getting the error **Cannot find module â€˜fs/promisesâ€™. Requires stack:** while using the **developer cli** or **arhc3js** make sure that you are using a node version higher than **v14**.

### Transaction submitted but was not yet found on the chain

If you get the error **Transaction with ID â€¦ was submitted but was not yet found on the chain**, you may want to check if your transaction requires more gas than the **max gas** setting. If the computation requires more gas than that it will never be included in a block.


### Error: spawn archwayd ENOENT

If you are getting the error **spawn archwayd ENOENT**, make sure to correctly set the *GOPATH*, as documented <a href="https://docs.archway.io/validators/becoming-a-validator/troubleshooting#archwayd-command-not-found-error" target="_blank">here</a>. 
If you are using Linux, you can launch:
::highlight-card

```bash
export GOPATH=$HOME/go 
export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin:$GOPATH/bin
```

::
And then update your terminal shell by launching:
::highlight-card

```bash
source ~/.profile"
```

::

Also, you can clean up your environment, so that you know exactly where archwayd is located and avoid complications.

If using the Developer CLI v1, you can try using the [Developer CLI v2](/developers/developer-tools/developer-cli) instead,does not have any dependency on *archwayd*. Also, the CLI v2 provides additional features with a smoother development cycle. 




### Invalid type: instantiate wasm contract failed 
Make sure to pass the right variable type. For example, if you are trying to pass a **bigint**,  keep in mind that **serde** deserializes **uint128** by expecting a  string on the input.

For example, instead of having the ```price```field like this:
```bash
    ""max"": 250,
    ""price"": 1000000000,
    ""denom"": ""aconst""
```

you should have it quoted:

```bash
    ""max"": 250,
    ""price"": "1000000000",
    ""denom"": ""aconst""
```



### How can i get a smart contract's balance?
Using something like the following:

::highlight-card
```rust
let balance = BankQuery::Balance { denom, address };
```
::

would get you a **BankQuery**. If you need a **String** or **u128** you would need to declare a **querier** and then use that to perform the query.  similarly to:

::highlight-card
```rust
let balance_response = querier.query(&balance_query.into())
```
::
And then convert the response  into a **Balance object**, from which you can extract the amount, and convert it into a **u128** or **String**:
::highlight-card
```rust
let balance: Balance = Balance::from(balance_response)
```
::
An example of that would be:

::highlight-card
```rust
 pub fn get_balance(
    deps: &DepsMut,
    env: Env,
) -> Result<u128, StdError> {
    let denom = DENOM.load(deps.storage)?;
    let address = env.contract.address.to_string();
    let balance_query = BankQuery::Balance { denom, address };
    let balance_response: BalanceResponse =
        deps.querier.query(&balance_query.into())?;
    let balance_u128 = balance_response.amount.amount.u128();
    Ok(balance_u128)
}
```
::

### How to send a contract multiMsg?
If you want to send a transaction with multiple signers to complete the transaction, you can use the  `signer.executeMultiple` with:
::highlight-card
```javascript
const signer = await SigningCosmWasmClient.connectWithSigner(network.endpoint, offlineSigner, {
gasPrice,
prefix: network.prefix,
});
```
::


### How to mint NFTs from another smart contract?

You could use the following example:
::highlight-card
```rust
let metadata = Metadata {
    image: None,
    image_data: None,
    external_url: None,
    description: None,
    name: None,
    attributes: None,
    background_color: None,
    animation_url: None,
    youtube_url: None,
};
let mint_msg = MintMsg {
    token_id: token_id,
    owner: info.sender.to_string(),
    token_uri: None,
    extension: metadata.clone(),
};
let exec_msg = ExecuteMsg::Mint(mint_msg.clone());

let message = SubMsg::new(WasmMsg::Execute {
    contract_addr: state.nft_address.ok_or(ContractError::EmptyNftMinter {})?.to_string(),
    msg: to_binary(&exec_msg)?,
    funds: vec![],
});
```
::

### How can i create a CW-20 token on Archway?

You can use the [Developer CLI](/developers/developer-tools/developer-cli), choose the *CW20* template and set the following parameters in the 
Instantiate transaction:
::highlight-card
```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, JsonSchema, Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub struct InstantiateMsg {
    pub name: String,
    pub symbol: String,
    pub decimals: u8,
    pub initial_balances: Vec<Cw20Coin>,
    pub mint: Option<MinterResponse>,
    pub marketing: Option<InstantiateMarketingInfo>,
}
```
::
The types you need for MinterResponse and InstantaiteMarketingInfo are:
::highlight-card
```rust
// Imported from `cw20`
pub struct MinterResponse {
    pub minter: String,
    pub cap: Option<Uint128>,
}
// Imported from `cw20`
pub enum Logo {
    Url(String),
    Embedded(EmbeddedLogo),
}
// Imported from `cw20`
pub enum EmbeddedLogo {
    Svg(Binary),
    Png(Binary),
}

// Defined in your msg.rs
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, JsonSchema, Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub struct InstantiateMarketingInfo {
    pub project: Option<String>,
    pub description: Option<String>,
    pub marketing: Option<String>,
    pub logo: Option<Logo>,
}

```
::

### What is the max gas limit on the transaction payload size for CosmWasm contracts?

The following RPC endpoint will pull in the max bytes per block and the maximum of gas that can be used per block:
 <a href="https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io/consensus_params" target="_blank">https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io/consensus_params</a>.

 ### Shoulf i use global constants or dynamic cw_storage_plus types?

You may wonder why sticking with global const (such as **Items**, **Maps**..) instead of dynamic **cw_storage_plus types**.


For example, if you have a contract that represents a game with multiple rounds, where you'd want to have a query to get a list of player's ticket counts in a given round, you could eiether:
- Use a map with a composite key, like:`ROUND_TICKETS = Map<(RoundNo, PlayerId), u32>` and `ROUND_TICKETS.prefix(round_no).range(...)`
- Or use an approach similar to the following:

::highlight-card
```rust
    fn get_player_ticket_counts(storage, round_no) {
      let map: Map<PlayerId, u32> =
        Map::new(format!("tickets{}", round_no).as_str());
      Ok(map.range(...).map(...).collect())
    }

```
::
and wonder what would be the correct approach.

The reason why it is a common design pattern to use global consts is that creating and managing variables dynamically might have higher gas costs compared to using pre-defined constants, especially if the dynamic creation is done frequently.  Also gobal constants can make it easier to understand contract's behavior and potential vulnerabilities easier.

Using a dynamic approach for variables can be way more convenient, as you can create state variables on-the-fly without the need to predefine them all. Anywaysm it can also lead to possible bugs where one accidentally crosses into the prefix range of some other "round" (as in the example) or corrupts the entire map in some other way. Keeping each round's ticket count in a separate map would help with preserve data integrity.


Depending on the use case, using dynamic types could lead to a more complex logic flow if not managed carefully.
In this specific example, the approach of using separate maps for each round's ticket counts simplifies the data structure and by isolating the data for each round gives easier understanding of contract's state, as well as an easier code readibility.

Re-instantiating the map on each call might introduce some minor overhead, but the additional cost of map instantiation might not be a significant factor.

Keep in mind though that in the latter approach re-instantiates the map on each call, and a block explorer probably wouldn't be an effective way to browse this contract's state.

### Should i use u32 or Uint32?
Using the *Uint32* cosmwasm wrapper, compared to *u32* can help prevent potential issues related to type mismatch and serialization. It is considered to be a safer approach for cw contract development. Additional info regarding *uint128* and *u128* can be alrady found <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76903404/in-contract-state-is-it-okay-to-use-regular-u128s-or-should-the-uint128-wrapper" target="_blank">here</a>.

### Error: SIGN_MODE_DIRECT canâ€™t be signed on Ledger

As Ledger does not support *Direct Signing Mode*,you would need to use the *Amino Signing Mode* instead:

::highlight-card
```javascript
return window.keplr?.getOfflineSignerAuto(chainId);
```
::
