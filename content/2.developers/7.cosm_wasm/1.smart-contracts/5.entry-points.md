# Entry Points
Entry points in CosmWasm are what allow the contract to handle messages and queries.

These handlers are:

- Instantiate messages, as defined by the ```InstantiateMsg``` struct, are handled by instantiate.
- Messages, as defined by the ```ExecuteMsg``` enum, are handled by the execute function, using a pattern-matching match statement.
- Queries, as defined by the ```QueryMsg``` enum, are handled by the query function, using a pattern-match.
execute and query must exhaustively match every variant in the enums they handle, while instantiate only has to deal with the struct it is passed.

Typically, instantiate and execute have the type ```Result<Response, ContractError>```, while query has ```StdResult<Binary>``` due to the underlying Cosmos SDK Querier.

As yu can see form the code snippet below, these handlers are explicitly flagged as entry points, and excluded from being bundled in the library:
```rust
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn instantiate(
  deps: DepsMut,
  _env: Env,
  _info: MessageInfo,
  msg: InstantiateMsg,
) -> Result<Response, StdError> {
  // ...etc
}
```
