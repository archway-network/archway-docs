# Math
The math functions used by cosmwasm are based upon standard rust, but helper functions are provided for u128, u64 and decimals.

## Uint128
A thin wrapper around u128 that is using strings for JSON encoding/decoding, such that the full u128 range can be used for clients that convert JSON numbers to floats, like JavaScript and jq.

##Uint64
A thin wrapper around u64 that is using strings for JSON encoding/decoding, such that the full u64 range can be used for clients that convert JSON numbers to floats, like JavaScript and jq.


## Decimal
A fixed-point decimal value with 18 fractional digits, i.e. Decimal(1_000_000_000_000_000_000) == 1.0 The greatest possible value that can be represented is 340282366920938463463.374607431768211455 (which is (2^128 - 1) / 10^18)
