# Query

Within CosmWasm, querying is a crucial component, being the counterpart to messages. Querying can be viewed as a means of reading data from a database or retrieving state information.

Generally, you will find the available query messages in `msg.rs` or `query.rs`, depending on how the contract author has
structured the code.

You can query using an external client (an API or via the CLI), or within a contract. Some of the finer details of how this works can be found in the [Querying Architecture section](../3.architecture/4.querying.md).

Queries access the data store of a contract in read-only mode. These queries can retrieve data and perform additional computations or processing as necessary. As a result, a gas limit is imposed.

Queries are comprised of an entry in the `QueryMsg` enum, and are handled in the contract's `query` function.

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub enum QueryMsg {
  // ResolveAddress returns the current address that the name resolves to
  ResolveRecord { name: String },
  Config {},
}
```

You can find the code for this example [here](https://github.com/InterWasm/cw-contracts/blob/main/contracts/nameservice/src/msg.rs#L20).

The contract then handles this in [the query function](https://github.com/InterWasm/cw-contracts/blob/main/contracts/nameservice/src/contract.rs#L95):

```rust
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn query(deps: Deps, env: Env, msg: QueryMsg) -> StdResult<Binary> {
  match msg {
    QueryMsg::ResolveRecord { name } => query_resolver(deps, env, name),
    QueryMsg::Config {} => to_binary(&config_read(deps.storage).load()?),
  }
}
```

Where `query_resolver` is just another function, and `config_read` is a helper that wraps access to the data store.
