# Introduction

## What is CosmWasm?

CosmWasm is a smart contract platform written as a module that can be integrated into any blockchain built on top of [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk). In simple terms, it is the Cosmos' (Cosm) way of utilizing WebAssembly (Wasm), hence its name.

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is currently the most widely used programming language for CosmWasm. In the future, it is possible that different programming languages, such as [Go](https://go.dev/), may also be used.

## Sections {#sections}

* [Getting Started](02-getting-started/01-intro.md) (TODO: Edit this link) helps you with modifying, deploying, and executing smart contracts on a local blockchain. It is the perfect place to get familiar with all the aspects of the system without having to put in too much effort coding.

* [Architecture](03-architecture/01-multichain.md) (TODO: Edit this link) explains much of the high-level design and architecture of CosmWasm. It is crucial to understand the mental model and capabilities of the system before designing products using it. However, if you prefer to learn through coding, you can skip this section and revisit it as needed.

* **Learn** demonstrates the development of smart contracts from zero to production with step-by-step explanations, code snippets, scripts, and more.
  * [Dev Academy](/dev-academy/intro) (TODO: Edit this link) provides structured learning content, starting from the basics of blockchains and smart contracts, to the Cosmos SDK, CosmWasm smart contracts, and clients.
  * [Tutorials](/tutorials/hijack-escrow/intro) (TODO: Edit this link) demonstrates the development of smart contracts from zero to production with step-by-step explanations, code snippets, scripts, and more.
  
* [Workshops](/tutorials/videos-workshops) (TODO: Edit this link) has a great collection of demonstrations and verbal explanations of the CosmWasm tech stack, recorded at various events and organizations.

* [Plus](/cw-plus/0.9.0/overview) (TODO: Edit this link) is for state-of-the-art, production-ready CosmWasm smart contracts.

## Additional Resources

In addition to this documentation, there are also many valuable resources available to aid you in your CosmWasm journey. Some of these include:

* [An array of example smart contracts](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-examples) to try out.
* Documentation for the [core contract libraries](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/index.html).
* Documentation for the [storage helpers](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-storage/latest/cosmwasm_storage/index.html).

There are a number of [high-level articles on Medium](https://medium.com/confio) that provide insight into the different components of the CosmWasm stack.

We extend our gratitude to the [Interchain Foundation](https://interchain.io/) for financing a significant portion of the development efforts that led to the production of CosmWasm.
