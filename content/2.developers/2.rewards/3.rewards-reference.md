# Rewards Reference

This guide is a list of the availabe queries and commands related to the rewards system.

## Rewards Queries

`archwayd query rewards block-rewards-tracking [flags]` - Query rewards tracking data for the current block height

`archwayd query rewards contract-metadata [contract-address] [flags]` - Query contract metadata (contract rewards parameters)

`archwayd query rewards estimate-fees [gas-limit] [flags]` - Query transaction fees estimation for a given gas limit

`archwayd query rewards outstanding-rewards [rewards-address] [flags]`- Query current credited rewards for a given address (the address set in contract(s) metadata rewards_address field)

`archwayd query rewards params [flags]` - Query module parameters

`archwayd query rewards pool [flags]` - Query the undistributed rewards pool (ready for withdrawal) and the treasury pool funds

`archwayd query rewards rewards-records [rewards-address] [flags]` - Query rewards records stored for a given address (the address set in contract(s) metadata rewards_address field) with pagination

## Transaction Commands

`archwayd tx rewards set-contract-metadata [contract-address] [flags]` - Create / modify contract metadata (contract rewards parameters)

`archwayd tx rewards withdraw-rewards [flags]` - Withdraw current credited rewards for the transaction sender. This command requires a few mandatory flags. To know the list of rewards to pull from, you need to either set the **record-ids** or **records-limit** flag. Additionally, the **from** flag must be set to the signer of the transaction, which must also act as a rewards address on one or more contracts. Here's an example of a working command:

```
archwayd tx rewards withdraw-rewards --chain-id "constantine-2" --node "https://rpc.constantine-2.archway.tech:443" --records-limit 100 --from mywallet --gas auto --gas-prices 0.05uconst --gas-adjustment 1.4 --broadcast-mode sync --output json -y
```
