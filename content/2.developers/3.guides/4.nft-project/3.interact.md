# Minting and sending tokens

Now that we've got our smart contract deployed we can transact with it to mint tokens that can be <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/hodl" target="_blank" >hodl'd</a> or sent to other Archway addresses.

## Minting tokens

<a href="https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts/blob/v0.9.3/contracts/cw721-base/src/msg.rs#L60-L72" target="_blank" >MintMsg</a> is a message type from the `cw721_base` package imported by our project's <a href="https://github.com/archway-network/archway-templates/blob/main/cw721/on-chain-metadata/Cargo.toml" target="_blank" >Cargo.toml</a>. It's used by our contract's execution handler to set state for an NFT with metadata corresponding to the <a href="https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts/blob/v0.9.3/contracts/cw721-base/src/state.rs#L91-L105" target="_blank" >TokenInfo model</a>we looked at previously.

To mint an NFT, we need to send a transaction to the smart contract with our **MintMsg** parameters in JSON format. For adding custom traits, we can use the on-chain metadata NFT template and include arbitrary metadata values using the extensions attribute of **MintMsg**.

This is the JSON string we will use to mint our test NFT:

```json
{
  "mint": {
    "token_id": "1",
    "owner": "archway1f395p0gg67mmfd5zcqvpnp9cxnu0hg6r9hfczq",
    "extension": {
      "name": "Archway NFT #1",
      "description": "Building With NFTs",
      "image": "ipfs://QmZdPdZzZum2jQ7jg1ekfeE3LSz1avAaa42G6mfimw9TEn",
      "attributes": [
        {
          "trait_type": "tutorial",
          "value": "https://docs.archway.io/developers/guides/nft-project/start"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

To execute our mint transaction we add the JSON arguments using the `--args` flag of **tx** command of the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@archwayhq/cli" target="_blank" >Archway Developer CLI</a>.
::highlight-card

```bash
archway tx --args '{"mint":{"token_id":"1","owner":"archway1f395p0gg67mmfd5zcqvpnp9cxnu0hg6r9hfczq","extension":{"name":"Archway NFT #1","description":"Building With NFTs","image":"ipfs://QmZdPdZzZum2jQ7jg1ekfeE3LSz1avAaa42G6mfimw9TEn","attributes":[{"trait_type":"tutorial","value":"https://docs.archway.io/developers/guides/nft-project/start"}]}}}'
```

Using most Archway commands, including **tx** and **query**, requires your terminal path to be at the root, or inside, of a folder created with the Archway Developer CLI
#title
Tip
::

To confirm the NFT is now correctly stored on-chain, run the **query** command, specifying the **token_id** declared in the minting transaction:
::highlight-card

```bash
archway query contract-state smart --args '{"nft_info":{"token_id":"1"}}'
# Show output here
```

::
The behaviour of the `nft_info` entrypoint is defined <a href="https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts/blob/v0.9.3/contracts/cw721-base/src/query.rs#L33-L39" target="_blank">here</a>  if you want to read the response model in detail.

## Sending tokens

To transfer a token, we have to send a message of the type `TransferNft`, which we achieve by sending a transaction to the <a href="https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts/blob/v0.9.3/contracts/cw721-base/src/execute.rs#L124-L139" target="_blank" >transfer_nft</a> entrypoint exposed by the contract. The params we send to the entrypoint are: the recipient address; and the **token_id** to be sent to the receiver.

In JSON format, our transaction arguments look like this:

```json
{
  "transfer_nft": {
    "recipient": "archway1y00hm50lffnxt5m0kuy9afk83gyuye684zwcr5",
    "token_id": "1"
  }
}
```

Using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@archwayhq/cli" target="_blank" >Developer CLI</a>, we broadcast the transaction and include the above parameters like this:
::highlight-card

```bash
archway tx --args '{"transfer_nft":{"recipient":"archway1y00hm50lffnxt5m0kuy9afk83gyuye684zwcr5","token_id":"1"}}'
```

::
Once the transaction is confirmed, ownership of the token will be changed from the address declared as owner at minting (`archway1f395p0gg67mmfd5zcqvpnp9cxnu0hg6r9hfczq` in this guides's example), to the new receiver address (`archway1y00hm50lffnxt5m0kuy9afk83gyuye684zwcr5` in this guides's example). To verify that's the case, we can query the contract again to see who owns the **token_id** with the value of **1**.
::highlight-card

```bash
archway query contract-state smart --args '{"nft_info":{"token_id":"1"}}'
# Show output here
```
