# Overview

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create a Lottery smart contract using the Archway Developer CLI but assisted by ChatGPT. The AI will guide you through the entire process, from setting up your project to deploying and interacting with your contract on the Archway blockchain.

Please make sure you've gone through the following [guide](/developers/getting-started/install) to install all the tools required for developing on Archway.

The following are the requirements for the lottery contract:

- An account enters the lottery by paying a small fee
- A winner is selected using a non-random solution

## Key tips for interacting with ChatGPT AI

To successfully create and deploy the Lottery smart contract using the Archway Developer CLI, you will interact with the ChatGPT AI to get clear, concise, and accurate instructions.

- Be Specific: Clearly state what you need help with. The more specific your question, the better the response.
- Use Code Blocks: When requesting code snippets, use code blocks to format your request.
- Follow Instructions: Ensure you follow the instructions provided by ChatGPT closely to avoid errors.
- Ask for Clarification: If any part of the response is unclear, ask for further clarification.
- Check Outputs: After running commands, check the outputs and return any errors or messages to ChatGPT for further assistance.

Here's a step-by-step guide on what to expect and how to interact effectively with ChatGPT AI:


## Archway custom GPT

We've created a custom GPT configured with a knowledge set that should help with building smart contracts on Archway. The custom GPT can be accessed [here](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-g9aIUiOOS-archway-smart-contract-engineer) and is the recommended GPT for building smart contracts on Archway.

## Initial prompt

You want to give ChatGPT an overview of what is to be built along with the requirements but still allowing you to go through individual prompts to do things step by step. 

The first step would be to create a new project. We recommend utilizing the Archway Developer CLI for managing your project. When starting a new project that is not baed on a fleshed out template the recommendation is to start with a blank template. Currently there is no set blank template but if you utilize the `Increment` template and selecting the `minimal` option, a blank contracy will be created. The following will therefore be the first prompt:

```
I want to build a Lottery smart contract on the Archway blockchain using the Archway Developer CLI. The contract should allow users to enter the lottery by paying a small fee, and a winner is selected to end the lottery who will receive the total collected fees. The winner selection will be deterministic, based on the block height, as randomness is not supported in CosmWasm smart contracts.

Can you guide me through the process step-by-step, starting with creating a new project and including all necessary files and commands?

I want to go through the process creating step by step prompts with the first prompt being, how do I create a new project using the Archway Developer CLI with the minimal version of the Increment contract template?
```

The response should guide you with the commands and selections required for creating this blank project via the Archway Developer CLI.

## Create contract data structure

In a CosmWasm smart contract project, the `state.rs` file is typically used to define and manage the data structures that represent the state of the smart contract. This includes defining the types and their serialization for storage, as well as the methods for interacting with the state.

The following would be the prompt:

```
How do I create the state.rs file to define the contract's state making sure to use the latest storage features?
```

## Create messages

In an Archway smart contract project, the `msg.rs` file is typically used to define the `messages` that the contract can handle. These messages represent the various commands or queries that can be sent to the smart contract by users or other contracts.

The following would be the prompt to get this file with the required messages created:

```
How do I create the msg.rs file to define the messages the contract will handle?
```

## Error handling

The `error.rs` file is used to define custom error types for the contract. These custom error types help to provide more meaningful error messages and better error handling within the contract. By using specific error types, developers can more easily diagnose and handle issues that arise during the execution of the contract.

The following would be the prompt:

```
How do I create the error.rs file to define custom errors for the contract?
```

## Contract logic

The main entry point for defining the core logic of the smart contract is stored in the `contract.rs` file. This file typically contains the primary functions that handle the execution of the contract's actions and queries. It orchestrates how the contract processes messages, manages state, and interacts with other modules of the project.


The following would be the prompt:

```
How do I create the contract.rs file to implement the core logic of the contract?
```

## Library file

The `lib.rs` file serves as the central module for the contract. It typically includes declarations that bring together various components of the contract, making them accessible from a single entry point. This file often contains module imports, exports, and any necessary configurations or macros.

The following would be the prompt:

```
How do I create the lib.rs file to tie everything together?
```

## Compiling the contract

Compiling an Archway smart contract involves transforming the Rust source code into WebAssembly (Wasm) bytecode. This bytecode is what gets deployed and executed on the Archway blockchain.


The following would be the prompt:

```
How do I compile the contract to generate the WebAssembly (WASM) file using the Archway Developer CLI?
```

## Deploying the contract

Deploying a smart contract involves uploading the compiled Wasm bytecode to the blockchain. This process registers the contract code with the blockchain so that it can be instantiated later.


The following would be the prompt:

```
How do I deploy the compiled contract to the Archway blockchain using the Archway Developer CLI?
```

## Instantiating the contract

Instantiating an Archway smart contract involves creating an instance of the uploaded Wasm bytecode on the blockchain with specific initial parameters. This step initializes the contract's state, generates a contract address and makes it ready for use.

The following would be the prompt:

```
How do I instantiate the deployed contract using the Archway Developer CLI?
```

## Entering the lottery

Executing a transaction involves sending a message to the instantiated contract to perform a specific action. This process updates the contract's state based on the logic defined in the contract's `ExecuteMsg` enum and associated functions.

The following would be the prompt should share how to go about executing a transaction to have an account enter the lottery:

```
How do I have an account enter the lottery by paying a small fee using the Archway Developer CLI?
```

## Drawing a winner

This would be another transaction that will select the winner.

The following would be the prompt:

```
How do I draw a winner from the participants using the Archway Developer CLI?
```

## Querying the contract

Querying involves sending a read-only request to the contract to retrieve data from its state. Queries do not modify the state of the contract; they simply fetch and return information.

The following would be the prompt:

```
How do I query the contract to get the lottery pool and participants using the Archway Developer CLI?
```
