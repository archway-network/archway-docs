# Requesting Testnet funds

If you're working on a testnet you will need testnet `$ARCH` for paying gas costs to deploy your dapp code on chain.

After [creating an account](../../getting-started/setup.md#creating-an-account), to request funds from the faucet use our Discord channel.

1. Join our Discord server at https://discord.gg/dnYYcKPAX5
2. Send the following message in the ðŸš° ï½œ faucet channel

::highlight-card

```bash
!faucet <address>
```

::
The funds will be deposited to your account in a few minutes on all testnets.
