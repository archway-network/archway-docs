# Deploy and instantiate contracts on-chain

Only optimized **wasm** files can be stored on chain. If your local project does not have an **artifacts** folder, or, if the **artifacts** folder is empty. Go back to the [previous guide step](./2.wasm.md) for information on producing _CosmWasm_ optimized executables.

## Storing contracts on chain

You can obtain free testnet **CONST** tokens to cover transaction fees on the **Constantine** testnet by using the faucet available on <a href="https://discord.gg/archwayhq" target="_blank">Discord</a>. For **Mainnet** you will need to acquire **ARCH** tokens.

When you are ready to store the **wasm** executable on chain, execute the following command via the Developer CLI:

::highlight-card
```bash
archway contracts store CONTRACT [--json] [--log-level debug|error|info|warn] [--instantiate-permission any-of|everybody|nobody] [--allowed-addresses <value>] [--keyring-backend file|os|test] [--keyring-path <value>] [-f <value>] [--fee <value>] [--no-confirm] [--gas-adjustment <value>]
```
::

**Arguments:**
::highlight-card
```bash
CONTRACT  (required) Name of the contract
```
::


Alternatively, you can utilize **archwayd**:

::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
mainnet
#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd tx wasm store artifacts/test_project2.wasm --from my-wallet --node https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443 --chain-id archway-1 --gas auto --gas-prices $(archwayd q rewards estimate-fees 1 --node 'https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443' --output json | jq -r '.gas_unit_price | (.amount + .denom)') --gas-adjustment 1.4
```

::

#title1
testnet

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd tx wasm store artifacts/test_project2.wasm --from my-wallet --node https://rpc.constantine.archway.io:443 --chain-id constantine-3 --gas auto --gas-prices $(archwayd q rewards estimate-fees 1 --node 'https://rpc.constantine.archway.io:443' --output json | jq -r '.gas_unit_price | (.amount + .denom)') --gas-adjustment 1.4
```

::

::

## Instantiating the contract

You can then instantiate your contract with the following command substituting **<contract-name\>** with the name of the contract you want to instantiate:

::highlight-card
```bash
archway contracts instantiate <contract-name> --args '{"my_key":"my value"}'
```
::

Since we cloned the **Increment** starter template, try instantiating with your **counter** argument set to **0**:

For example, if using the archway CLI:

::highlight-card

```bash
archway contracts instantiate increment --args '{"count":0}'
```

::



If you are using **archwayd** then the following command should work:

::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
mainnet
#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd tx wasm instantiate 795 '{"count":0}' --from my-wallet --node https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443 --chain-id archway-1 --label testdev --admin archway1c23y29x9fcs4zlfv5tvl4nrq56p6gywq0snrxl --gas auto --gas-prices $(archwayd q rewards estimate-fees 1 --node 'https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443' --output json | jq -r '.gas_unit_price | (.amount + .denom)') --gas-adjustment 1.3
```
::

#title1
testnet

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd tx wasm instantiate 795 '{"count":0}' --from my-wallet --node https://rpc.constantine.archway.io:443 --chain-id constantine-3  --label testdev --admin archway1c23y29x9fcs4zlfv5tvl4nrq56p6gywq0snrxl --gas auto --gas-prices $(archwayd q rewards estimate-fees 1 --node 'https://rpc.constantine.archway.io:443' --output json | jq -r '.gas_unit_price | (.amount + .denom)') --gas-adjustment 1.3
```

::

::

In the case of using **archwayd**, you need to add the **Code Id** (which you can see by looking at the **store** transaction data and set the **admin** address. You can check that information and the contract address on a [blockexplorer](/resources/blockexplorers)).


So why are we sending our constructor as **{"count":0}** and how can we verify it's correct?

From your project files open **src/contract.rs**. Near the top, is the function **pub fn instantiate**, which works as a constructor and sets the initial state of the contract:

```rust
pub fn instantiate(
  deps: DepsMut,
  _env: Env,
  info: MessageInfo,
  msg: InstantiateMsg,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
  let state = State {
    count: msg.count, // Here's our count declaration
    owner: info.sender.clone(), // Contract owner is wallet that sent tx
  };
  STATE.save(deps.storage, &state)?; // Save the state
  // More code...
}
```

You will see that the **msg** parameter is of type **InstantiateMsg** which is defined in the **src/msg.rs** file and contains the values that can be submitted in a JSON object format:

```rust
...
pub struct InstantiateMsg {
    pub count: i32,
}
```

In your history you should see that two actions were created:

- the **store** transaction happened when the wasm executable was uploaded to the chain
- The **instantiate** transaction, which created an instance of the contract with its own state

The following command will historical deployment actions:

::highlight-card
```bash
archway config deployments
```
::

Example output:

::highlight-card
```bash

You can also access this historical data from the "**.archway**" folder, where a respective file for each chain is stored, containing the historical data. For Archway testnet, for example, the file would be **constantine-3.json**.

## Configuring the deployed contract

Now that the dapp is deployed, it's recommended to set its metadata. This will allow you to configure the smart contract to collect rewards.

To set contract metadata, use the command:

::highlight-card
```bash
archway contracts metadata CONTRACT [--json] [--log-level debug|error|info|warn] [--owner-address <value>] [--rewards-address <value>][--keyring-backend file|os|test] [--keyring-path <value>] [-f <value>] [--fee <value>] [--no-confirm] [--gas-adjustment <value>]
```
::

A basic example would be:

::highlight-card
```bash
archway contracts metadata increment2 --owner-address "archway12qj4v8jg5pxk6gsqct09sf9szhwql69xmf9fh4"  --rewards-address="archway12qj4v8jg5pxk6gsqct09sf9szhwql69xmf9fh4"
```
::

**Arguments**:
::highlight-card
```bash
CONTRACT (required) Name of the contract
```
::


Example output:

::highlight-card

```bash
archway contracts metadata increment2 --owner-address "archway12qj4v8jg5pxk6gsqct09sf9szhwql69xmf9fh4"  --rewards-address="archway12qj4v8jg5pxk6gsqct09sf9szhwql69xmf9fh4"
✔ Enter the name or address of the account that will send the transaction … archway12qj4v8jg5pxk6gsqct09sf9szhwql69xmf9fh4

## Set contract premiums

To set a contract premium the contract must have the rewards metadata already configured. You would use the following command to set the premium:

::highlight-card
```bash
archway contracts premium CONTRACT --premium-fee <value> [--json] [--log-level debug|error|info|warn] [--keyring-backend file|os|test] [--keyring-path <value>] [-f <value>] [--fee <value>] [--no-confirm] [--gas-adjustment <value>]
```
::

A basic example would be:

::highlight-card
```bash
archway contracts premium increment2 --premium-fee "1000000000000000000aconst" --from "mywallet" 
```
::

**Arguments**:
::highlight-card
```bash
CONTRACT (required) Name of the contract
```
::

Example output:

::highlight-card
```bash
Setting premium for contract increment2
  Chain: constantine-3
  Contract: archway1aj4u4qdfqdnenmj4zn99wc8qev09wseytg0xr8eerwk7v0uhsevsqjf6zl

  Signer: mywallet
