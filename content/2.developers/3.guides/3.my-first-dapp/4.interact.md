# Interacting with your contract

Let's proceed to generating transactions and retrieving information from the contract we have deployed.

## Querying

Queries read from the blockchain. They don't modify anything stored on chain, so they do not incur any gas fees.

There are several types of queries we can perform, but a common type that we are interested in is **contract-state**, which we will call in **smart** mode. This enables us to run queries with arguments, instead of dumping the entire contract data or metadata.

If we query the **count** before modifying any state, we get the value we set during instantiation:

::highlight-card
```bash
archway contracts query smart CONTRACT [STDININPUT] [--json] [--log-level debug|error|info|warn] [--no-validation] [--args <value> | --args-file <value>| ]
```
::

A basic example for our increment contract would be:

::highlight-card
```bash
archway contracts query smart increment --args '{"get_count": {}}'
```
::

Outputs:

::highlight-card
```bash
{
  "count": 0
}
```
::

Why was the query argument **{"get_count": {}}**?

If we open **src/contract.rs** and inspect the function **pub fn query**, we will see the case matching statement that matches our JSON query:

::highlight-card

```rust
pub fn query(deps: Deps, _env: Env, msg: QueryMsg) -> StdResult<Binary> {
  match msg {
      QueryMsg::GetCount {} => to_binary(&query_count(deps)?), // Here it is
  }
}
```

::
::alert{variant="info"}
**QueryMsg** is an **enum** with the **GetCount** property, defined in the **src/msg.rs** file. It is good to be aware of the format here, as the enum attribute is uppercase without spaces in Rust, but lowercase with snake case when converted to JSON arguments. This is controlled by the attribute **#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]** right above the **QueryMsg** definition.

## Transacting

To increment our counter value, we'll be executing a transaction that calls the function **pub fn try_increment** in **src/contract.rs**. This function is already public, but the transaction execution is handled by the function **pub fn execute** in **src/contract.rs**, which does pattern matching to call **try_increment**.

Sending an Increment transaction, using the archway CLI:


::highlight-card
```bash
archway contracts execute increment --args '{"increment": {}}'
```
::


::alert{variant="info"}
If you ever receive an out of gas error you can always use the **--gas-adjustment** flag and set a value of 1.5 or more.

Sending an Increment transaction, using **archwayd**:

::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
mainnet
#desc0
::highlight-card


```bash
archwayd tx wasm execute --chain-id archway-1 archway188u72zstacfq4uknszr0cqry8vn68ynrcfcee4xjlmk6v2vhewysnkr798  '{"increment": {}}' --from my-wallet --node https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443 --gas auto --gas-prices $(archwayd q rewards estimate-fees 1 --node 'https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443' --output json | jq -r '.gas_unit_price | (.amount + .denom)') --gas-adjustment 1.3
```

::

#title1
testnet

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd tx wasm execute --chain-id constantine-3 archway188u72zstacfq4uknszr0cqry8vn68ynrcfcee4xjlmk6v2vhewysnkr798  '{"increment": {}}' --from my-wallet --node https://rpc.constantine.archway.io:443 --gas auto --gas-prices $(archwayd q rewards estimate-fees 1 --node 'https://rpc.constantine.archway.io:443' --output json | jq -r '.gas_unit_price | (.amount + .denom)') --gas-adjustment 1.3
```

::

::


Example output:

::highlight-card
```bash
✔ Enter the name or address of the account that will send the transaction … mywallet
Executing contract increment2
  Chain: constantine-3
  Signer: mywallet

✅ Executed contract  increment2-0.1.0
  Transaction: CEFC1B9F6AE482249C3F6F3ED1C723F25FA8C129F53F5169544931207769311A
```

Why is the argument {**"increment":** {}}?

If we open **src/contract.rs** and inspect the **pub fn execute** function, we'll see a pattern matching statement that matches our JSON argument:

::highlight-card
```rust
pub fn execute(
  deps: DepsMut,
  _env: Env,
  info: MessageInfo,
  msg: ExecuteMsg,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
  match msg {
    ExecuteMsg::Increment {} => try_increment(deps), // Here it is
    ExecuteMsg::Reset { count } => try_reset(deps, info, count),
  }
}
```
::

As you can see, **enum** attributes again are converted. **ExecuteMsg::Increment {}** becomes {"**increment**": {}} in the CLI.

::alert{variant="info"}
While it doesn't apply to our Increment dapp, for dapps collecting payments, the <a href="https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/struct.MessageInfo.html" target="_blank">MessageInfo</a>  struct is how developers can access and process incoming funds. Both native chain assets and <a href="https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus/blob/main/packages/cw20/README.md" target="_blank">cw20</a>  tokens are supported by the **funds** attribute of **MessageInfo**.

::highlight-card

```rs
pub struct MessageInfo {
  pub sender: Addr,
  pub funds: Vec<Coin>,
}
```

::

When collecting payments in Archway's native token (e.g. **ARCH** for mainnet, **CONST** for Constantine testnet) amounts sent in **funds** should use the chain's minimum denomination (e.g. **aarch** for mainnet, **aconst** for Constantine testnet). Sending payment with other denominations (e.g. **ARCH**, or **CONST**) will fail with an error.

Info
::

If our { "**increment**": {}} transaction succeeded and we query **count** again, it will have increased by **1***:
::highlight-card

```bash
archway contracts query smart increment --args '{"get_count": {}}'
```

::

Now outputs:

::highlight-card

```bash
{
  "count": 1
}
```
