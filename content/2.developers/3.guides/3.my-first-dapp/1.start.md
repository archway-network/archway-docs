# Project Setup

This guide outlines the following workflow:

1. [Create a new project](#creating-a-project)
2. [Request testnet Tokens](../2.faucet.md)
3. [Produce _default_ and _CosmWasm_ **wasm** binaries](./3.wasm.md)
4. [Deploy to a testnet](./4.deploy.md)
5. [Create transactions and query data from a deployed contract](./5.interact.md)
6. [Build a dapp frontend](./6.dapp.md)

## Creating a project

In the [Setup](../../1.getting-started/2.setup.md) section we learned how to create and configure a new Archway project.

Projects created with **archway new** can use our predefined templates or are start from a blank canvas. For this guide we will be using the Increment template. 

If you haven't created a project or selected the '**Increment**' starter template, please return to the [Setup](../../1.getting-started/2.setup.md) section to finish this step. Make sure you have the [Archway Developer CLI](/developers/developer-tools/developer-cli) installed.
