# Project Setup

This guide outlines the following workflow:

1. [Create a new project](#creating-a-project)
2. [Build your code](#building)
3. [Request testnet Tokens](../2.faucet.md)
4. [Produce _default_ and _CosmWasm_ **wasm** binaries](./3.wasm.md)
5. [Deploy to a testnet](./4.deploy.md)
6. [Create transactions and query data from a deployed contract](./5.interact.md)
7. [Build a dapp frontend](./6.dapp.md)

## Creating a project

In the [Setup](../../1.getting-started/2.setup.md) section we learned how to create and configure a new Archway project.

Projects created with **archway new** can use our predefined templates or are start from a blank canvas. For this guide we will be using the Increment template. If you haven't created a project or selected the 'Increment' starter template, please return to the [Setup](../../1.getting-started/2.setup.md) section to finish this step.

Let's build the boilerplate code you have first, and then add code and modify existing behavior. 

## Building

Build your project using the command:
::highlight-card

```bash
archway build
```

::
Example output:
::highlight-card

```bash
Building project...

  Updating crates.io index
  Compiling libc v0.2.99
  Compiling typenum v1.13.0
  # And so on until ...
  Compiling my-project v0.1.0 (/home/my-system-path/my-project)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 31.42s
```
