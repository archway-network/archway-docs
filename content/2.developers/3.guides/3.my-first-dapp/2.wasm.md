# Wasm executables

In order to deploy your contracts to the blockchain you need to build an optomized **wasm** executable.

For building and optimizing your contracts we use the [Rust Optimizer](https://github.com/CosmWasm/rust-optimizer) and specifically the **Workspace Optimizer** which allows for building and optimizing multiple contracts within a project. This is all done via Docker and the reason Docker is a dependency for the Developer CLI.

The workspace-optimizer will make sure that the WASM binary is as small as possible in order to minimize fees and blockchain storage.

## Build and optimize your contracts

From within the project folder build your project using the command:

::highlight-card
```bash
archway contracts build
```
::

Example output:

::highlight-card
