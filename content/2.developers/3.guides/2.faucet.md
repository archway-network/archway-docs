# Requesting Testnet Tokens

In order to deploy your dapp code on chain while working on a testnet, it will be necessary to have the respective testnet Tokens to cover the associated gas costs. Once you have [set up an account](/developers/getting-started/setup#creating-an-account), you can request funds from the faucet by using our Discord channel.

1. Join our Discord server <a href="https://discord.gg/dnYYcKPAX5" target="_blank">here</a>
2. Send the following message in the ðŸš° ï½œ faucet channel

::highlight-card

```bash
!faucet <address>
```

::
The tokens will be deposited into your account within a few minutes on all available testnets.
