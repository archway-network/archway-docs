# Introduction

The introduction of the CW-Fees module significantly enhances how dapps can cover transaction fees for accounts within the Archway ecosystem. The **x/feegrant** module which is a core component of the Cosmos SDK had limitations that prevented a smart contract from assuming the Fee Granter role. Now, the CW-Fees module enables this capability, providing considerable flexibility in how fees are handled.

To get a better understanding of how the Fee Granter system works, see [Understanding grant allowances](/developers/guides/fee-grant/introduction).

## How does it work?

The CW-Fees module presents two crucial message entry points: **RegisterAsGranter** and **UnregisterAsGranter**. The **RegisterAsGranter** message allows a contract to establish itself as a fee granter. Upon registration, the network recognizes the contract as a qualified fee granter. Subsequently, the contract must handle incoming requests at the **SudoMsg::CwGrant** entry point to manage such requests.

The **UnregisterAsGranter** simply allows for removing a contract as a fee granter.

## Register as granter

You can create an endpoint to set and remove the contract as a **Granter** but this can also be done in the instantiate method and will be executed when a contract is instantiated. Let's look at an example of how this can be done.

```rust
/// MsgRegisterAsGranter is used to register a a granter.
#[allow(clippy::derive_partial_eq_without_eq)]
#[derive(Clone, PartialEq, ::prost::Message)]
pub struct MsgRegisterAsGranter {
    #[prost(string, tag = "1")]
    pub granting_contract: ::prost::alloc::string::String,
}

#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn instantiate(
  deps: DepsMut,
  _env: Env,
  _: MessageInfo,
  msg: InstantiateMsg,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
  let contract_address = env.contract.address.to_string();

  let regsiter_msg = MsgRegisterAsGranter {
    granting_contract: contract_address.clone(),
  };

  let register_stargate_msg = CosmosMsg::Stargate {
    type_url: "/archway.cwfees.v1.MsgRegisterAsGranter".to_string(),
    value: Binary::from(prost::Message::encode_to_vec(&regsiter_msg)),
  };

  Ok(Response::new()
    .add_attribute("action", "register")
    .add_message(register_stargate_msg))
}
```

With this now registered, the contract can now act as a Fee Granter to pay the transaction fees onbehalf of other accounts. In the event of a transaction, the user can designate a registered CosmWasm contract as the **Tx.AuthInfo.Fee.Granter**.

## Accept fee grant requests

In order for your contract to accept fee grant requests it will need to implement a new **Sudo** entrypoint. Please note that only the Archway protocol can make **Sudo** entrypoint calls. The following is an example.

```rust
// State variable holding all grantees that qualify for a grant
pub const GRANTS: Map<&Addr, Empty> = Map::new("grants");

#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn sudo(
  deps: DepsMut,
  _env: Env,
  msg: SudoMsg,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
  return match msg {
    SudoMsg::CwGrant(grant) => {
      sudo_grant(deps, grant)
    }
  }
}

fn sudo_grant(deps: DepsMut, msg: CwGrant) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
  // add a malicious case in which if the fee request contains a hack denom
  // then we basically compute forever.
  for fee in &msg.fee_requested {
    if fee.denom == "malicious" {
      let mut x = 0;
      loop {
        x+=1
      }
    }
  }
  // in order to pay the fees all message senders need to be
  // in the grants list.
  for m in &msg.msgs {
    let sender = deps.api.addr_validate(&m.sender)?;
    if !GRANTS.has(deps.storage, &sender) {
      return Err(ContractError::Unauthorized {})
    }
  }

  Ok(Response::default())
}
```

A **CwGrant** message is submitted to the **sudo_grant** function that provides information that can be used to to make an informed decision regarding the grant request. In this example we populate a **GRANTS** state variable with addresses that can receive grants and in the function that will execute the grant we first check that the calling account is in the list. If the contract approves (i.e., returns no errors), the runtime automatically manages the transfer of fees from the contract to the auth collector. If the contract decides to reject the grant, it must return an error response.
