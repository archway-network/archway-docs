#  Using grant allowances to execute transactions

As one of the primary use case of the Fee Grant module is to help with onboarding new users, this section of the guide will show how to allow users to execute transactions using the allowance granted to them.

## Query a grant allowance

Now that an allowance has been assigned to an account address, you should be able to verify the details of that grant. The returned information will include the granter's address, the allowance amount, and any other conditions set by the granter, such as the expiration date of the allowance. 

The following command using archwayd will give the details of a grant allowance:

```console
archwayd query feegrant grant "${granter_address}" "${grantee_address}" --chain-id constantine-3 --node https://rpc.constantine.archway.io:443
```

**Results**:

```
allowance:
  '@type': /cosmos.feegrant.v1beta1.BasicAllowance
  expiration: null
  spend_limit:
  - amount: "4806067100000000000"
    denom: aconst
grantee: archway1vve3d5u89h966t8kcvemwu88rnzzgcqxvkuj4s
granter: archway1u0p8vfpf5gjwje84073x0d6w40vm2s25603359
```

This can also be achieved via the following API endpoint where **api_endpoint** is an API endpoint connected to one of the Archway networks (Testnet or Mainnet). **granter** is the address that granted the allowance and **grantee** is the address that received the allowance:

```
{api_endpoint}/cosmos/feegrant/v1beta1/allowance/{granter}/{grantee}
```

**Results**:

```
{
  "allowance": {
    "granter": "archway1u0p8vfpf5gjwje84073x0d6w40vm2s25603359",
    "grantee": "archway1vve3d5u89h966t8kcvemwu88rnzzgcqxvkuj4s",
    "allowance": {
      "@type": "/cosmos.feegrant.v1beta1.BasicAllowance",
      "spend_limit": [
        {
          "denom": "aconst",
          "amount": "4806067100000000000"
        }
      ],
      "expiration": null
    }
  }
}
```

## Creating a Transaction

Just like any other transaction on **Archway**, a transaction that will use a granted allowance for fees must include certain information, such as the type of transaction (i.e., the message). Instead of the normal fee object, the transaction should include the granter's account which will pay the transaction fee. <!--So instead of setting the **fee** value to **auto** we use the **calculateFee** method to dynamically generate the fee, it should be added the **feeGranterAddress** which is the address of the **granter** that will cover the fees.--> This is accomplished by doing the following:

```js
const fee = await signingClient.calculateFee(signerAddress, messages, '', 1.5, feeGranterAddress);
      
const broadcastResult = await signingClient.signAndBroadcast(signerAddress, messages, fee);
```

The **signAndBroadcast** method does not allow for setting the **feeGranterAddress** address to stipulate that this account should cover the fees and therefore a custom fee object should be generated which is made available within **arch3.js** via the **calculateFee** method as shown <a href="https://github.com/archway-network/arch3.js/blob/main/packages/arch3-core/src/signingarchwayclient.ts#L425" target="_blank">here</a>. This fee is then plugged into the **signAndBroadcast** method and if there is an allowance from the **feeGranterAddress** for the **signerAddress** then the amount will be deducted from the  **feeGranterAddress**. If not, the fee will be deducted from the **signerAddress**.

This is main difference in executing a transaction with fees paid for by the signer as opposed to the fees paid for by a fee grant allwoance.

## Basic keplr example

The following example will allow a user to increment the counter is our basic **increment** contract which you can create easily from a template within [**Archway CLI**](/developers/developer-tools/developer-cli). The following setup [guide](/developers/getting-started/setup#creating-a-project) will help to create and deploy such a contract on Archway.

### Prerequisites

Before moving forward, ensure that you have completed the following prerequisites:

- Install the <a href="https://www.keplr.app/download" target="_blank">Keplr</a> extension on your browser
- Install the [arch3.js](/developers/developer-tools/arch3js/introduction#installation) library within your project

### Create config

Create a new config file in your project. You can name the file **triomphe.config.js** if using mainnet, or **constantine.config.js** if using testnet. The file should contain the following content:

::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
mainnet

#desc0
::highlight-card


```javascript
const currency = {
  coinDenom: 'ARCH',
  coinMinimalDenom: 'aarch',
  coinDecimals: 18,
  coinGeckoId: 'archway',
};

const ChainInfo = {
  chainId: 'archway-1',
  chainName: 'Mainnet',
  rpc: 'https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io',
  rest: 'https://api.mainnet.archway.io',
  stakeCurrency: currency,
  bip44: {
    coinType: 118,
  },
  bech32Config: {
    bech32PrefixAccAddr: 'archway',
    bech32PrefixAccPub: 'archwaypub',
    bech32PrefixValAddr: 'archwayvaloper',
    bech32PrefixValPub: 'archwayvaloperpub',
    bech32PrefixConsAddr: 'archwayvalcons',
    bech32PrefixConsPub: 'archwayvalconspub',
  },
  currencies: [currency],
  feeCurrencies: [currency],
  coinType: 118,
  features: ['cosmwasm', 'ibc-transfer', 'ibc-go'],
  // walletUrlForStaking: '',
};

export default chainInfo;
```

::

#title1
testnet

::highlight-card


```javascript
const currency = {
  coinDenom: 'CONST',
  coinMinimalDenom: 'aconst',
  coinDecimals: 18,
  coinGeckoId: 'constantine-network',
};

const ChainInfo = {
  chainId: 'constantine-3',
  chainName: 'Constantine',
  rpc: 'https://rpc.constantine.archway.io',
  rest: 'https://api.constantine.archway.io',
  stakeCurrency: currency,
  bip44: {
    coinType: 118,
  },
  bech32Config: {
    bech32PrefixAccAddr: 'archway',
    bech32PrefixAccPub: 'archwaypub',
    bech32PrefixValAddr: 'archwayvaloper',
    bech32PrefixValPub: 'archwayvaloperpub',
    bech32PrefixConsAddr: 'archwayvalcons',
    bech32PrefixConsPub: 'archwayvalconspub',
  },
  currencies: [currency],
  feeCurrencies: [currency],
  coinType: 118,
  features: ['cosmwasm', 'ibc-transfer', 'ibc-go'],
  // walletUrlForStaking: '',
};

export default chainInfo;
```

## Connecting to keplr

1. The following imports are required to complete your transaction.


::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
mainnet

#desc0
::highlight-card

```javascript
import { SigningArchwayClient } from '@archwayhq/arch3.js';
import ChainInfo from './triomphe.config.js';
import { MsgExecuteContract } from 'cosmjs-types/cosmwasm/wasm/v1/tx.js';
import { toUtf8 } from '@cosmjs/encoding';
```

::

#title1
testnet

#desc1
::highlight-card

```javascript
import { SigningArchwayClient } from '@archwayhq/arch3.js';
import ChainInfo from './constantine.config.js';
import { MsgExecuteContract } from 'cosmjs-types/cosmwasm/wasm/v1/tx.js';
import { toUtf8 } from '@cosmjs/encoding';
```

::

2. Next, verify that <a href="https://docs.keplr.app/api" target="_blank">Keplr</a> is installed on the browser and has at least one account set up. If Keplr is installed, use the <a href="https://docs.keplr.app/api/suggest-chain.html" target="_blank">suggestChain</a> method to add the **Constantine** network to Keplr. Also, to prevent Keplr from overriding fees set by **arch3.js**, set the **Interactive Option** value of **preferNoSetFee** to **true**.

::highlight-card

```javascript
window.onload = async () => {
    if (!window.getOfflineSignerAuto || !window.keplr) {
        alert("Please install keplr extension");
    } else {
        if (window.keplr.experimentalSuggestChain) {
            try {
                await window.keplr.experimentalSuggestChain(ChainInfo);

                window.keplr.defaultOptions = {
                    sign: {
                        preferNoSetFee: true,
                    }
                }
            } catch {
                alert("Failed to suggest the chain");
            }
        } else {
            alert("Please use the recent version of keplr extension");
        }
    }
};
```

::

3. Enable the chain to then connect to it.

::highlight-card

```javascript
const chainId = ChainInfo.chainId;
await window.keplr.enable(chainId);
```

::

4. Create an offline signer using the **getOfflineSignerAuto** method and also a signing client using **SigningArchwayClient**.

::highlight-card

```javascript
const offlineSigner = window.getOfflineSigner(chainId);
const signingClient = await SigningArchwayClient.connectWithSigner(ChainInfo.rpc, offlineSigner);
```

::

5. Obtain the signer's account, which will provide their address.

::highlight-card

```javascript
const accounts = await offlineSigner.getAccounts();
const signerAddress = accounts[0].address;
```

::

## Execute transaction

1. Set the fee granter and contract addresses.

::highlight-card

```javascript
const smartContractAddress = process.env.SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS;
const feeGranterAddress = process.env.FEE_GRANTER_ADDRESS;
```

::

2. Define the transaction details which includes the message to the contract.

::highlight-card

```javascript
// Increment contract message to increase counter
const contractMsg = {
    increment: {},
};

// Message to execute a transaction via the smart contract
const executeMsg = {
    typeUrl: '/cosmwasm.wasm.v1.MsgExecuteContract',
    value: MsgExecuteContract.fromPartial({
        sender: signerAddress,
        contract: smartContractAddress,
        msg: toUtf8(JSON.stringify(contractMsg)),
        funds: [],
    }),
};

const messages = [executeMsg];
```

::

3. Calculate the fee dynamically but also set **fee granter address** will pay the transaction fee if an allowance exists. The **memo** is set to an **empty string** and the **fee adjustment** is set to **1.5**.

::highlight-card

```javascript
const fee = await signingClient.calculateFee(signerAddress, messages, '', 1.7, feeGranterAddress);
```

::

2. Sign and broadcast the transaction.

::highlight-card

```javascript
const broadcastResult = await signingClient.signAndBroadcast(signerAddress, messages, fee);

if (broadcastResult.code !== undefined &&
    broadcastResult.code !== 0) {
    alert("Failed to send tx: " + broadcastResult.log || broadcastResult.rawLog);
} else {
    alert("Succeed to send tx:" + broadcastResult.transactionHash);
}
```
::
