# Grant allowance

Building a smart contract dapp that enables users to request a fee grant is a challenging task since all transactions necessitate the payment of transaction fees. However, there are several methods that can be utilized. Here are a few examples:

- The granter can manually execute each fee grant allowance transaction using the **archwayd** CLI
- Construct a deployment script containing addresses that you wish to assign a fee grant to. This script will utilize the **archwayd** CLI to perform the fee grant transaction for each specified address.
- Implement a simple frontend application that verifies and validates a user's account. After confirming that they are the account owner, the application would execute a Javascript transaction with **arch3.js** to carry out the fee grant transaction.

## Create allowance using archwayd

The **archwayd** CLI is a key tool for accessing the fundamental functionalities of the **Archway** Blockchain. To install **archwayd**, refer to this [link](/developers/developer-tools/daemon). Here is an illustration of a typical transaction for creating a grant allowance:

```console
archwayd tx feegrant grant "${granter_addr}" "${grantee_address}" \
    --chain-id "${chain_id}" \
    --node "${rpc_endpoint}" \
    --spend-limit 500000000000000000aarch \
    --expiration 2025-12-31T23:00:00Z \
    --allowed-messages '/cosmwasm.wasm.v1.MsgExecuteContract' \
    --gas auto \
    --gas-prices "$(gas-prices-estimate)" \
    --gas-adjustment 1.3 \
    --broadcast-mode block \
    --output json \
    --yes
```

Let's break down a few of the components:

- **${granter_addr}**: This value represents the address of the account providing tokens to the **grantee** for transaction execution.
- **${grantee_address}**: This denotes the account receiving tokens, enabling it to perform transactions using these grants.
- **allowed-messages**: Through the **AllowedMsgAllowance** type, you can limit the message type a grantee can use the grant for.
- **expiration**: The deadline by which the allowance must be used or it will expire.
- **spend-limit**: The maximum allowance provided to the grantee. This amount is adjusted as tokens are utilized.

## Create allowance using arch3.js

This section demonstrates how to create a grant allowance using **arch3.js**. By following the steps outlined in this section, you'll be able to create a signing client, structure a grant allowance message, and execute the necessary transaction which will grant allowances to designated accounts. Let's dive in and explore the process of creating allowances using **arch3.js**.

1. Create the signing client that will be used to execute the transaction:

```js
const signingClient = await SigningArchwayClient.connectWithSigner(network.endpoint, wallet);
```

2. The allowance message comprises three essential components: the **granter**, **grantee**, and the actual **allowance**. As previously mentioned, the **granter** is the address responsible for granting the allowance, while the **grantee** is the recipient who can utilize the granted allowance. The **allowance** component is slightly more intricate, with its structure dependent on the specific type of allowance employed.

To illustrate, let's examine the structure of a **basicAllowance** using the following example:

```js
const basicAllowance = {
    typeUrl: "/cosmos.feegrant.v1beta1.BasicAllowance",
    value: Uint8Array.from(
        BasicAllowance.encode({
        spendLimit: [
            {
            denom: "aconst",
            amount: "5000000000000000000",
            },
        ],
        }).finish(),
    ),
};
```

Therefore, the combined message would appear as follows:

```js
const msgGrantAllowance = {
    granter: granterAddress,
    grantee: granteeAddress,
    allowance: basicAllowance,
};

const typeUrl = "/cosmos.feegrant.v1beta1.MsgGrantAllowance";
const msgAny = { typeUrl, value: msgGrantAllowance };
```

Now, all that remains is to execute the transaction:

```js
const broadcastResult = await signingClient.signAndBroadcast(
    granterAddress,
    [msgAny],
    'auto',
    'Fee Grant', // optional memo
);
```

You can find a working example of this script in the <a href="https://github.com/archway-network/dapp-examples/tree/main/plain_javascript/fee-grant" target="_blank">dapp examples</a> repository.
