# Debugging

Tips and tricks for debugging Archway projects.

<!-- ## Debugging Rust contracts -->
<!-- ## Writing unit tests -->

## Debug the developer CLI

Sometimes the CLI panics inside of a Node.js thread and exits with a nondescript error message. You can trace the actual source of the error by setting **DEBUG=***

Example:
::highlight-card

```bash
DEBUG=* archway deploy --args '{ "name": "debugger", "symbol": "dbg!", "minter": "archway1f395p0gg67mmfd5zcqvpnp9cxnu0hg6r9hfczq" }'
```

::

## Debug failing transactions

If your transaction is failing use the **cargo schema** command to regenerate the schema requirements for your project. The generated files will explain the exact keys, types, and values that are permissible for the entrypoints of the contract.

Example:
::highlight-card

```bash
$ cargo schema
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.10s
     Running `target/debug/examples/schema`
Removing "/home/user/projects/increment-project/schema/state.json" …
Removing "/home/user/projects/increment-project/query_msg.json" …
Removing "/home/user/projects/increment-project/instantiate_msg.json" …
Removing "/home/user/projects/increment-project/count_response.json" …
Removing "/home/user/projects/increment-project/execute_msg.json" …
Created /home/user/projects/increment-project/instantiate_msg.json
Created /home/user/projects/increment-project/execute_msg.json
Created /home/user/projects/increment-project/query_msg.json
Created /home/user/projects/increment-project/state.json
Created /home/user/projects/increment-project/count_response.json
```

::

Now you can print the regenerated schema for **instantiate_msg** to see the type and format requirements for your specific instantiation.

Example:
::highlight-card

```bash
$ cat schema/instantiate_msg.json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "title": "InstantiateMsg",
  "type": "object",
  "required": [
    "count"
  ],
  "properties": {
    "count": {
      "type": "integer",
      "format": "int32"
    }
  }
}
```

::
The above schema tells us that we need to send arguments to the deployer in the format **--args '{"count":0}'**. For example, sending them as **--args '{"count":"0"}'** will result in a failure.


## Debugging with **RUST_LOG**

When working with Rust projects, you can use the **RUST_LOG** environment variable to control the logging output. This can be particularly helpful in debugging complex issues. For instance, you can set **RUST_LOG** to different log levels like **info**, **debug**, or **trace** to get more detailed logs:
::highlight-card
```bash
RUST_LOG=debug cargo test
```
::
This command will show more detailed logs while running tests, which can help you identify issues within your smart contract code.
