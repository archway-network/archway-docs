# Relayer exporter

The [Relayer Exporter](https://github.com/archway-network/relayer_exporter) is a monitoring tool for the Archway Network, designed to provide insights into the health and activity of IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) relayers. By exporting metrics, the tool helps network operators and developers monitor the performance of relayers on the Archway blockchain in real time, enabling better management and diagnostics.

## Key features

- **IBC Relayer Monitoring:** Export metrics on the status, performance, and health of IBC relayers operating on the Archway network.
- **Prometheus-Compatible:** Integrates with Prometheus, making it easy to collect and visualize metrics through Grafana or other monitoring tools.
- **Real-Time Data:** Provides real-time monitoring of relayer activity to ensure smooth cross-chain communication and troubleshoot potential issues.
- **Customizable:** Configure the exporter to track specific metrics, tailored to the unique needs of your relayer setup.

## How it works

The **Relayer Exporter** collects key performance indicators of relayers by querying the relevant data from the Archway blockchain and exports it in a format that can be scraped by Prometheus. This allows network operators to visualize relayer performance metrics, such as:

- Transaction success/failure rates
- Relayer uptime
- Packet relay latency
- Number of relayed transactions

With these metrics, operators can ensure their relayers are functioning optimally, detect failures early, and improve the overall health of the cross-chain infrastructure.
