# Developer CLI

The Developer CLI is the recommended tool to build, deploy, configure, instantiate, query, and interact with smart contracts on the Archway blockchain. 

We've introduced version 2 of the CLI, which now boasts a stable release and offers numerous enhancements over its predecessor:
- We've removed **archwayd** as a dependency, facilitating a more straightforward installation and flow. This change also boosts speed and efficiency.
- Commands have been restructured, and new sub-commands have been introduced.
- We've added commands to query and withdraw rewards, ensuring a seamless experience when managing rewards.


## Dependencies

Make sure you've installed and configured all dependencies. For the full
installation and setup instructions, [visit the docs](https://docs.archway.io/developers/getting-started/install).

- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm "Install Node.js and NPM")

- [cargo-generate](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-generate "Install Cargo Generate")

If you are on a Linux machine with a distribution different from Ubuntu, you may need to install the [GNOME Keyring](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GNOME/Keyring), or any other keyring compatible with the [Secret service API](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/auth/Secret-Service-API.html).

For a detailed overview of the various commands, refer to the README file in the [Archway CLI repo](https://github.com/archway-network/cli#commands).

## Import devnet into CLI

For builders looking to test their dapps on the new **devnet (titus-2)** and prepare for the **v5** upgrade, simply execute the following command to import the **titus-2** chain into the Archway CLI:

```bash
curl -fsSL 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/archway-network/networks/main/devnets/archwaydevnet/chain.json' | archway config chains import
```
