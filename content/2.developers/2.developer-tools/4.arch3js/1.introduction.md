# arch3.js

<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@archwayhq/arch3.js" target="_blank">arch3.js</a> is a JavaScript library that makes it easy for developers to build web applications and tools that interact with the Archway network. It acts as a drop-in replacement for the CosmJS client library, extending its functionality and allowing for easier interaction with Archway's reward and fee sub-systems.

To delve deeper into the internal mechanics of arch3.js, refer to the API documentation available at <a href="https://archway-network.github.io/arch3.js" target="_blank">https://archway-network.github.io/arch3.js</a>.

## Installation

To install arch3.js, you have the option of using either <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@archwayhq/arch3.js" target="_blank">npm</a> or yarn:

### NPM

::highlight-card

```bash
npm install --save @archwayhq/arch3.js
```

::

### Yarn

::highlight-card

```bash
yarn add @archwayhq/arch3.js
```

## Archway fees

With the introduction of version **0.2.0** of **arch3.js**, it's important to note that setting the **gas price** is no longer necessary when configuring **SigningArchwayClient**. Previously, this could have resulted in arbitrary fee computation, potentially causing users to pay excessive fees. However, with the introduction of the <a href="https://github.com/archway-network/archway/blob/main/docs/adr/ADR-005-minimum-price-of-gas.md" target="_blank">Minimum Price of Gas</a> and the increase in the native token's **decimal precision** from **10^6** to **10^18**, the impact of setting arbitrary gas prices is now more evident. The previous requirement was as follows:

::highlight-card

```javascript
const offlineSigner = window.keplr.getOfflineSigner("constantine-3");
const signingClient = await SigningArchwayClient.connectWithSigner("https://rpc.constantine.archway.tech", offlineSigner, {
    gasPrice: GasPrice.fromString('0.02aconst'),
});
```

::

Now, you simply do the following:

::highlight-card

```javascript
const offlineSigner = window.keplr.getOfflineSigner("constantine-3");
const signingClient = await SigningArchwayClient.connectWithSigner("https://rpc.constantine.archway.tech", offlineSigner);
```

### Automatically calculate fees

When configuring the **fee** for a transaction, you have three options to choose from. Firstly, you can manually set the **fee** using a <a href="https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/blob/main/packages/amino/src/signdoc.ts#L12" target="_blank">StdFee</a> object. However, it is not recommended to do so due Archway's [Minimum Price of Gas](https://github.com/archway-network/archway/blob/main/docs/adr/ADR-005-minimum-price-of-gas.md) and [Minimum Consensus Fee](https://github.com/archway-network/archway/blob/main/docs/adr/ADR-003-minimum-consensus-fee.md) features. By arbitrarily setting a fee, you run the risk of overpaying or not setting the fee high enough to complete the transaction successfully.

In certain cases, there will be the need to set a custom fee value, such as when using **cosmjs** directly, utilizing other third party libraries or your own custom solution. To help with dynamically calculating fees, you can refer to the **arch3.js** implementation [here](https://github.com/archway-network/arch3.js/blob/v0.2.0/packages/arch3-core/src/signingarchwayclient.ts#L344).

Alternatively, you can let **arch3.js** automatically calculate the **fee** by using the "**auto**" value. Another option is to set a **number** that performs the same function as "**auto**" but overrides the default **multiplier** with the specified number. Implementation details can be found [here](https://github.com/archway-network/arch3.js/blob/v0.2.0/packages/arch3-core/src/signingarchwayclient.ts#L332). 

Here is an example using "**auto**":

::highlight-card

```javascript
const broadcastResult = await signingClient.signAndBroadcast(
    accounts[0].address,
    [msgAny],
    "auto",
    memo, // optional
);
```

::

Here is an example using a number:

::highlight-card

```javascript
const broadcastResult = await signingClient.signAndBroadcast(
    accounts[0].address,
    [msgAny],
    1.4,
    memo, // optional
);
```

::

Keep in mind, using "**auto**" in the **CosmJS** library triggers the default Cosmos SDK fee simulator. However, this simulator isn't equipped to precisely compute the correct fee for transactions within Archway. For a more comprehensive view on how Archway manages fees and gas, please refer to the following [page](/developers/getting-started/understanding-gas-fees).

### Keplr fee overrides

By default, Keplr overrides the transaction fee setting on the signing page, regardless of whether the frontend has defined its own fees which is the case with **arch3.js**. This has led to significantly higher transaction fees in some instances. To address this problem, we recommend that dapp frontends make use of the [Interactive Options](https://docs.keplr.app/api/#interaction-options) feature within Keplr. This feature will give priority to the frontend-suggested fee instead of overriding it.

::highlight-card

```javascript
window.keplr.defaultOptions = {
    sign: {
        preferNoSetFee: true,
    }
}
```

::

The following is a screenshot of how the **Interactive Option** displays the fee within the Keplr window. While the frontend sets the default fee, users still have the choice to override the fee if desired:
