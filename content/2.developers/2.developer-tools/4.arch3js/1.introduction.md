# arch3.js

<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@archwayhq/arch3-core" target="_blank">arch3.js</a> is a JavaScript library that makes it easy for developers to build web applications and tools that interact with the Archway network. It acts as a drop-in replacement for the CosmJS client, extending its functionality and allowing for easier connectivity with Archway's reward system.

To delve deeper into the internal mechanics of arch3.js, refer to the API documentation available at <a href="https://archway-network.github.io/arch3.js" target="_blank">https://archway-network.github.io/arch3.js</a>.

## Keplr fees

By default, Keplr overrides the transaction fee setting on the signing page, regardless of whether the frontend has defined its own fees. This has led to significantly higher transaction fees in some instances. To address this problem, we recommend that dapp frontends make use of the [Interactive Options](https://docs.keplr.app/api/#interaction-options) feature within Keplr. This feature will give priority to the frontend-suggested fee instead of overriding it.
