# arch3.js

<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@archwayhq/arch3.js" target="_blank">arch3.js</a> is a JavaScript library that makes it easy for developers to build web applications and tools that interact with the Archway network. It acts as a drop-in replacement for the CosmJS client, extending its functionality and allowing for easier connectivity with Archway's reward and fee systems.

To delve deeper into the internal mechanics of arch3.js, refer to the API documentation available at <a href="https://archway-network.github.io/arch3.js" target="_blank">https://archway-network.github.io/arch3.js</a>.

## Installation

To install arch3.js, you have the option of using either <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@archwayhq/arch3.js" target="_blank">npm</a> or yarn:

### NPM

::highlight-card

```bash
npm install --save @archwayhq/arch3.js
```

::

### Yarn

::highlight-card

```bash
yarn add @archwayhq/arch3.js
```

## Archway fees

With the introduction of version **0.2.0** of **arch3.js**, it is important to note that there is no longer a need to set the **gas price** when configuring the **SigningArchwayClient**. Previously, this could have resulted in aritrary fee computation, potentially causing users to pay excessive fees. However, with the introduction of the [Minimum Price of Gas](https://github.com/archway-network/archway/blob/main/docs/adr/ADR-005-minimum-price-of-gas.md) and the increase in the network's native token's **decimal precision** from **10^6** to **10^18**, the impact of setting arbitrary gas prices is now more evident. The previous requirement was as follows:

::highlight-card

```javascript
const offlineSigner = window.keplr.getOfflineSigner("constantine-3");
const signingClient = await SigningArchwayClient.connectWithSigner("https://rpc.constantine.archway.tech", offlineSigner, {
    gasPrice: GasPrice.fromString('0.02aconst'),
});
```

::

Now, you simply do the following:

::highlight-card

```javascript
const offlineSigner = window.keplr.getOfflineSigner("constantine-3");
const signingClient = await SigningArchwayClient.connectWithSigner("https://rpc.constantine.archway.tech", offlineSigner);
```

### Automatically calculate fees

When configuring the **fee** for a transaction, you have three options to choose from. Firstly, you can manually set the **fee** using a [StdFee](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/blob/main/packages/amino/src/signdoc.ts#L12) object. However, it is not recommended to do so due Archway's [Minimum Price of Gas](https://github.com/archway-network/archway/blob/main/docs/adr/ADR-005-minimum-price-of-gas.md) and [Minimum Consensus Fee](https://github.com/archway-network/archway/blob/main/docs/adr/ADR-003-minimum-consensus-fee.md) solutions, which are dynamically calculated each time a transaction is to be executed. By arbitrarily setting the fee, you run the risk of overpaying or not setting the fee high enough to complete the transaction successfully.

In certain cases, there will be a need to set a custom fee value, such as when using **cosmjs** directly, implementing other third party libraries or your own custom solution. To help with dynamically calculating fees, you can refer to **arch3.js** implementation [here](https://github.com/archway-network/arch3.js/blob/v0.2.0/packages/arch3-core/src/signingarchwayclient.ts#L344).

Alternatively, you can let **arch3.js** automatically calculate the **fee** by using the "**auto**" value. Another option is to set a **number** that performs the same function as the "**auto**" value but overrides the default **multiplier** with the specified number. Implementation details can be found [here](https://github.com/archway-network/arch3.js/blob/v0.2.0/packages/arch3-core/src/signingarchwayclient.ts#L332). 

Here is an example using "**auto**":

::highlight-card

```javascript
const broadcastResult = await signingClient.signAndBroadcast(
    accounts[0].address,
    [msgAny],
    "auto",
    memo, // optional
);
```

::

Here is an example using a number:

::highlight-card

```javascript
const broadcastResult = await signingClient.signAndBroadcast(
    accounts[0].address,
    [msgAny],
    1.4,
    memo, // optional
);
```

### Keplr fee overrides

By default, Keplr overrides the transaction fee setting on the signing page, regardless of whether the frontend has defined its own fees which is the case with **arch3.js**. This has led to significantly higher transaction fees in some instances. To address this problem, we recommend that dapp frontends make use of the [Interactive Options](https://docs.keplr.app/api/#interaction-options) feature within Keplr. This feature will give priority to the frontend-suggested fee instead of overriding it.

::highlight-card

```javascript
window.keplr.defaultOptions = {
    sign: {
        preferNoSetFee: true,
    }
}
```

::

The following is a screenshot of what the **Interactive Option** provides. While the frontend sets the default fee, users still have the choice to override the fee if desired:
