# Transaction and query execution

The following examples demonstrate the execution of a simple query and transaction. Both examples assume that you have deployed the <a href="https://github.com/archway-network/archway-templates/tree/f5860a7/increment" target="_blank">increment</a> contract on the Constantine testnet. To learn how to deploy the increment contract, see [Deploying your contract on chain](/developers/guides/my-first-dapp/deploy).

## Querying

A query action is used to retrieve information from the blockchain without modifying the state of the blockchain. Since it is a read-only operation, queries do not require transaction fees.

### Querying a contract

::highlight-card

```js
import { ArchwayClient } from '@archwayhq/arch3.js';

const client = await ArchwayClient.connect('https://rpc.constantine-2.archway.tech');

const contractAddress = 'archway14v952t75xgnufzlrft52ekltt8nsu9gxqh4xz55qfm6wqslc0spqspc5lm';
const msg = {
  get_count: {},
};
const { count } = await client.queryContractSmart(
  contractAddress,
  msg
);
``` 

::

### Querying core protocol (using archway client)

The following request retrieves the list of currently active validators in the Archway network using the **ArchwayClient** from arch3.js.

::highlight-card

```js
import { ArchwayClient, SigningArchwayClient } from '@archwayhq/arch3.js';

const signingClient = await ArchwayClient.connect('https://rpc.constantine-2.archway.tech');

const validators = await signingClient.tmClient.validatorsAll();
console.log(validators);
``` 

::

### Querying core protocol (using a HTTP client)

You will need to install **axios**:

::highlight-card

```bash
npm i axios
```

::

The following request retrieves the list of currently active validators in the Archway network using the **Axios** HTTP client.

::highlight-card

```js
import axios from 'axios';

let apiEnpoint = 'https://api.constantine-2.archway.tech';

axios.get(apiEnpoint + '/cosmos/staking/v1beta1/validators')
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

## Transaction

A transaction operation is used to create, sign, and broadcast messages that modify the state of the blockchain. A fee is required when executing transactions.

::highlight-card

```js
import { SigningArchwayClient } from '@archwayhq/arch3.js';
import { DirectSecp256k1HdWallet } from '@cosmjs/proto-signing';

const network = {
  chainId: 'constantine-2',
  endpoint: 'https://rpc.constantine-2.archway.tech',
  prefix: 'archway',
};

const alice = {
  // This is an incomplete mnemonic used for demo purposes only. Please, never hard code your seed phrases.
  mnemonic: 'culture blossom ten thing bar ...',
  address0: 'archway1cw3vd33zxyy5jk38azn3l8ytw53dwh8h73jugf',
};

const wallet = await DirectSecp256k1HdWallet.fromMnemonic(alice.mnemonic, { prefix: network.prefix });
const client = await SigningArchwayClient.connectWithSigner(network.endpoint, wallet, {
  ...defaultSigningClientOptions,
  prefix: network.prefix,
});

const contractAddress = 'archway14v952t75xgnufzlrft52ekltt8nsu9gxqh4xz55qfm6wqslc0spqspc5lm';
const msg = {
  increment: {},
};
const { transactionHash } = await client.execute(
  alice.address0,
  contractAddress,
  msg,
  'auto'
);
```
