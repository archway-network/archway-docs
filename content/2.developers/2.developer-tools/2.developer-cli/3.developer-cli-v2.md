# Developer CLI v2 (alpha)

The Developer CLI v2 introduces several improvements compared to v1:
- Removal of **archwayd** as a dependency. This enables a simpler installation and flow, as well as enhancing speed and efficiency.
- Commands have been re-organized and new sub-commands have been introduced.
- Commands to query and withdraw rewards have been added, providing for a seamless experience for managing rewards.


The <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@archwayhq/cli/v/2.0.0-alpha.1" target="_blank" >Archway CLI v2</a> is currently in alpha testing. We recommend trying it out and submit any feedback in the <a href="https://github.com/archway-network/archway-cli/discussions/210" target="_blank" >Github Discussion</a>.
