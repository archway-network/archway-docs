# Developer CLI

The Developer CLI is the recommended tool to build, deploy, configure, instantiate, query, and interact with smart contracts. 

There are currently two main releases:


- [Archway CLI v2 (alpha)](/developers/developer-tools/developer-cli/developer-cli-v2)
- [Archway CLI v1](/developers/developer-tools/developer-cli/developer-cli-v1)


The CLI v2 introduces several improvements compared to v1:
- Removal of **archwayd** as a dependency. This enables a simpler installation and flow, as well as enhancing speed and efficiency.
- Commands have been re-organized and new sub-commands have been introduced.
- Commands to query and withdraw rewards have been added, providing for a seamless experience for managing rewards.


The <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@archwayhq/cli/v/2.0.0-alpha.1" target="_blank" >Archway CLI v2</a> is currently in alpha testing. We recommend trying it out and submit any feedback in the <a href="https://github.com/archway-network/archway-cli/discussions/210" target="_blank" >Github Discussion</a>.

## Dependencies

### Nodejs / Npm

Make sure to install node <a href="https://nodejs.org/en" target="_blank" >node </a> (v18.17.1 or above) and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank" >npm</a>.


### Docker

Docker is needed as a dependency both in CLI v1 and v2, because of the <a href="https://github.com/CosmWasm/rust-optimizer" target="_blank" >rust optimizer</a>. This is because the optimizer needs to be configured in a way which can run in multiple platforms and generate a valid WASM binary that is supported by the chain is. Relying on Docker makes it way easier to control all platform and architecture dependencies required to produce a valid WASM file.

Docker is needed only for the rust optimizer (both on CLI v1 and v2), as the docker version of archwayd is not supported anymore from the CLI v1 since v1.6.0.
