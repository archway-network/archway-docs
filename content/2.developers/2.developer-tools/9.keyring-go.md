# Keyring go

This is a Go-based library for managing keyrings within the Archway ecosystem. This tool provides a secure and efficient way to handle key storage and cryptographic operations in Go-based applications. It supports multiple backends for keyring storage, including filesystem, memory, and hardware-backed solutions, making it a flexible choice for developers working on blockchain applications.

Its Capabilities include:

- **Multi-Backend Support:** Keyring Go offers various backends for key storage, including filesystem, in-memory, and hardware security modules (HSM).
- **Secure Key Management:** Provides robust key management, ensuring secure storage and handling of private keys.
- **Compatible with Go Applications:** Designed to integrate seamlessly into Go-based applications, providing developers with a native solution for cryptographic operations.
- **Blockchain Integration:** Optimized for use within blockchain ecosystems like Archway, supporting cryptographic functions and key management needs specific to blockchain networks.
- **HD Wallet Support:** Includes support for Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets, allowing for secure generation and management of multiple keys from a single seed.

## Getting Started:

**Keyring Go** can be easily integrated into your Go applications to handle key storage and cryptographic functions. Here’s how to get started:

1. **Installation:**
   Add the **Keyring Go** package to your Go project by running:
   ```bash
   go get github.com/archway-network/keyring-go
   ```

2. **Choose a Backend:** 
   Depending on your needs, select one of the supported keyring backends, such as filesystem, in-memory, or HSM.

3. **Create and Manage Keys:**
   Use the library’s simple API to create, retrieve, and manage cryptographic keys securely within your Go application.

## Example Usage:

Here’s a quick example of how to use **Keyring Go** in a Go project:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/archway-network/keyring-go"
)

func main() {
    kr, err := keyring.New("myApp", keyring.BackendFile, "myFilePath", nil)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error creating keyring:", err)
        return
    }

    // Generate a new key
    newKey, err := kr.NewAccount("myKey", "mySeed", "", "password", "", "")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error generating key:", err)
        return
    }

    fmt.Println("New key generated:", newKey.Address)
}
```

This example demonstrates how to create a new keyring, generate a key, and retrieve its address.

## Use Cases:
- **Blockchain Applications:** Securely manage and store private keys for interacting with the Archway blockchain or other blockchain ecosystems.
- **Cryptographic Operations:** Handle secure cryptographic operations like key generation, signing, and encryption in Go-based projects.
- **HD Wallets:** Manage HD wallets for applications requiring multiple keys generated from a single seed.
