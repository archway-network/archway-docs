## Archwayd for Developers

If you require functionality not available in the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@archwayhq/cli" target="_blank" >Developer CLI</a>, you may need to rely on **archwayd** to complete your task. Below are some examples of common queries and commands that can help guide you.

### Query account balance

For querying an account balance, use the **bank** module:

::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd query bank balances <account-address> --node "https://rpc.constantine-1.archway.tech:443"
```

::
by replacing <**account-address**> with your own value.


### Deploy a contract

Transactions use the **tx** module. Ideally, deployments will include three transactions: 
1) Storing the wasm on-chain
2) Instantiating the stored wasm
3) Setting the contract metadata.

Upload and store the wasm on-chain:
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd tx wasm store path_to_wasm/my_wasm_file.wasm --gas auto --gas-prices 0.05uconst --gas-adjustment 1.4 --from <wallet-label> --chain-id "constantine-1" --node "https://rpc.constantine-1.archway.tech:443" --broadcast-mode sync --output json -y
```

::
by replacing <**wallet-label**> with your own value.


The response from storing wasm will give you the Code ID required for instantiating the contract.

Then instantiate it:
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd tx wasm instantiate <code.id> '{"entrypoint":"value"}' --from <wallet-label> --label "A human readable label for this deployment" --gas auto --gas-prices 0.05uconst --gas-adjustment 1.4 --chain-id "constantine-1" --node "https://rpc.constantine-1.archway.tech:443" --broadcast-mode sync --output json -y
```

::
by replacing <**code-id**>, **{"entrypoint":"value"}**, <**wallet-label**> and
**"A human readable label for this deployment** with your own values.


The response from instantiating the contract will give you the Contract Address required for setting metadata on the contract instance.

Setting metadata on the contract instance:
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd tx gastracker set-contract-metadata <contract-address> '{ "owner_address": <admin-address>, "reward_address": <rewards-receiver-address>, "collect_premium": false, "premium_percentage_charged": 0, "gas_rebate_to_user": false }' --gas auto --gas-prices 0.05uconst --gas-adjustment 1.4 --from <wallet-label> --chain-id "constantine-1" --node "https://rpc.constantine-1.archway.tech:443" --broadcast-mode sync --output json -y
```

::
by replacing <**contract-address**>, <**wallet-label**>, and <**admin-address**>, <**rewards-receiver-address**> and the other JSON values with your own values.


### Transaction filtering

Searching transactions with custom filters is a powerful feature. To do this we use the **tx** module with the **--events** filter. See below for common filtered queries that are helpful.

#### View all transactions to a specific contract:

Use filter key **wasm._contract_address**

Example:
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd query txs --events 'wasm._contract_address=<contract-address>' --node "https://rpc.constantine-1.archway.tech:443"
```

::
by replacing <**contract-address**> with your own value.

#### View all contracts deployed by a specific developer:

User filter keys **message.sender** and **message.action**

Example:
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd query txs --events 'message.sender=<developer-wallet-address>&message.action=/cosmwasm.wasm.v1.MsgInstantiateContract' --node "https://rpc.constantine-1.archway.tech:443"
```

::
by replacing <**developer-wallet-address**> with your own value.


### Code IDs and contract metadata:

Contract data and metadata queries use the **wasm** query module.

#### Find the Code ID of a specific contract:

::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd query wasm contract <contract-address> --node "https://rpc.constantine-1.archway.tech:443"
```
::

by replacing <**contract-address**> with your own value.


#### Check if a contract's code was ever updated:
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd query wasm contract-history <contract-address> --node"https://rpc.constantine-1.archway.tech:443"
```

::
by replacing <**contract-address**> with your own value.


#### Find the contract address of a specific Code ID:

::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd query wasm list-contract-by-code <code-id> --node "https://rpc.constantine-1.archway.tech:443"
```
::

by replacing <**code-id**> with your own value.
