## Archwayd for Developers

If you require functionality not available in the [Developer CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@archwayhq/cli), you may need to rely on `archwayd` to complete your task. Below are some examples of common queries and commands that can help guide you.

### Query account balance

For querying an account balance, use the `bank` module.

Example:
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd query bank balances ${ACCOUNT_ADDRESS} --node "https://rpc.constantine-1.archway.tech:443"
```

::
::alert{variant=""}
Replace `${ACCOUNT_ADDRESS}` with your own value.
#title
Note
::

### Deploy a contract

Transactions use the `tx` module. Ideally, deployments will include 3 transactions: 1) Storing the wasm on-chain, 2) Instantiating the stored wasm, and 3) Setting the contract metadata.

Upload and store the wasm on-chain:
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd tx wasm store path_to_wasm/my_wasm_file.wasm --gas auto --gas-prices 0.05uconst --gas-adjustment 1.4 --from ${WALLET_LABEL} --chain-id "constantine-1" --node "https://rpc.constantine-1.archway.tech:443" --broadcast-mode sync --output json -y
```

::
::alert{variant=""}
Replace `${WALLET_LABEL}` with your own value
#title
Note
::

The response from storing wasm will give you the Code ID required for instantiating the contract.

Then instantiate it:
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd tx wasm instantiate ${CODE_ID} '{"entrypoint":"value"}' --from ${WALLET_LABEL} --label "A human readable label for this deployment" --gas auto --gas-prices 0.05uconst --gas-adjustment 1.4 --chain-id "constantine-1" --node "https://rpc.constantine-1.archway.tech:443" --broadcast-mode sync --output json -y
```

::
::alert{variant=""}
Replace `${CODE_ID}`, `'{"entrypoint":"value"}'`, `${WALLET_LABEL}` and
`"A human readable label for this deployment` with your own values.
#title
Note
::

The response from instantiating the contract will give you the Contract Address required for setting metadata on the contract instance.

Setting metadata on the contract instance:
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd tx gastracker set-contract-metadata ${CONTRACT_ADDRESS} '{ "developer_address": ${ADMINISTRATOR_ADDRESS}, "reward_address": ${ADDRESS_TO_RECEIVE_REWARDS}, "collect_premium": false, "premium_percentage_charged": 0, "gas_rebate_to_user": false }' --gas auto --gas-prices 0.05uconst --gas-adjustment 1.4 --from ${WALLET_LABEL} --chain-id "constantine-1" --node "https://rpc.constantine-1.archway.tech:443" --broadcast-mode sync --output json -y
```

::
::alert{variant=""}
Replace `${CONTRACT_ADDRESS}`, `${WALLET_LABEL}`, and `${ADMINISTRATOR_ADDRESS}`, `${ADDRESS_TO_RECEIVE_REWARDS}` and the other JSON values with your own values.
#title
Note
::

### Transaction filtering

Searching transactions with custom filters is a powerful feature, to do this we use the `tx` module with the `--events` filter. See below for common filtered queries that are helpful.

#### View all transactions to a specific contract:

Use filter key `wasm._contract_address`

Example:
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd query txs --events 'wasm._contract_address=${CONTRACT_ADDRESS}' --node "https://rpc.constantine-1.archway.tech:443"
```

::
::alert{variant=""}
Replace `${CONTRACT_ADDRESS}` with your own value.
#title
Note
::

#### View all contracts deployed by a specific developer:

User filter keys `message.sender` and `message.action`

Example:
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd query txs --events 'message.sender=${DEVELOPER_WALLET_ADDRESS}&message.action=/cosmwasm.wasm.v1.MsgInstantiateContract' --node "https://rpc.constantine-1.archway.tech:443"
```

::
::alert{variant=""}
Replace `${DEVELOPER_WALLET_ADDRESS}` with your own value.
#title
Note
::

### Code IDs and contract metadata:

Contract data and metadata queries use the `wasm` query module.

#### Find the Code ID of a specific contract:

::highlight-card

````bash
archwayd query wasm contract ${CONTRACT_ADDRESS} --node "https://rpc.constantine-1.archway.tech:443"
```
::

::alert{variant=""}
Replace `${CONTRACT_ADDRESS}` with your own value.
#title
Note
::

#### Check if a contract's code was ever updated:
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd query wasm contract-history ${CONTRACT_ADDRESS} --node"https://rpc.constantine-1.archway.tech:443"
````

::
::alert{variant=""}
Replace `${CONTRACT_ADDRESS}` with your own value.
#title
Note
::

#### Find the contract address of a specific Code ID:

::highlight-card

````bash
archwayd query wasm list-contract-by-code ${CODE_ID} --node "https://rpc.constantine-1.archway.tech:443"
```
::

::alert{variant=""}
Replace `${CODE_ID}` with your own value.
