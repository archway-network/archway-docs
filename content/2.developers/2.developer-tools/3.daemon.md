# Archwayd CLI

The Archwayd CLI is a tool that empowers you to interact seamlessly with the Archway protocol. Leveraging the **archwayd** core daemon, it allows you to execute a wide array of operations, from sending transactions to querying the blockchain's state and beyond.

The Archwayd CLI is not strictly limited to those running their own nodes. You can engage with the network even without hosting a node personally. You can utilize the Archwayd CLI to submit transactions or probe the network's state via RPC. This opens up opportunities for a variety of users to interact with the Archway blockchain network, making it a versatile tool for a range of operations.

Please note that even if you can use the Archwayd CLI to store, instantiate and manage contracts, it is recommended to use the [Developer CLI](/developers/developer-tools/developer-cli) for these purposes, as it provides a smoother developer experience.


::alert{variant="info"}
Since the release of [Archway CLI v2](/developers/developer-tools/developer-cli), **archwayd** is no longer a dependency for the Developer CLI.

## Installation

You can download the latest release of the pre-built binary from the <a href='https://github.com/archway-network/archway/releases' target='_blank'>releases page</a>.


For Linux, and depending on your architecture:


::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
amd64

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
wget https://github.com/archway-network/archway/releases/download/$$archwayVersion$$/archwayd_linux_amd64
```

::

#title1
arm64

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
wget https://github.com/archway-network/archway/releases/download/$$archwayVersion$$/archwayd_linux_arm64

```

::

::



You can now verify the download by generating the sha256 hash for the downloaded file:







::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
amd64

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
sha256sum archwayd_linux_amd64
```

::

#title1
arm64

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
sha256sum archwayd_linux_arm64

```

::

::



Using the *sha256sum* should give you a string (i.e.
*04fac46745579a7e8b22fc3b1f83dcf5c1aa2b03e303823eb54d2328e7c1fa05*).

You can then download the sha256 checksum file relative to the release file:

::highlight-card
```bash
wget archwaysha256.txt https://github.com/archway-network/archway/releases/download/$$archwayVersion$$/archwayd_$$archwayVersion$$_checksums.txt

```
::

and you can compare that the sha256 hash strings match, By doing so, you are ensuring that the downloaded file matches the actual release file.

## Archwayd for Developers

If you require functionality not available in the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@archwayhq/cli" target="_blank" >Developer CLI</a>, you may need to rely on **archwayd** to complete your task. Below are some examples of common queries and commands that can help guide you.

### Query account balance

For querying an account balance, use the **bank** module:


::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
mainnet

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd query bank balances <account-address> --node "https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443" --chain-id archway-1
```


::

#title1
testnet

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd query bank balances <account-address> --node "https://rpc.constantine.archway.tech:443" --chain-id constantine-3
```


::

::

### Deploy a contract

Transactions use the **tx** module. Ideally, deployments will include three transactions: 
1) Storing the wasm on-chain
2) Instantiating the stored wasm
3) Setting the contract metadata.

Upload and store the wasm on-chain:




::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
mainnet

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd tx wasm store path_to_wasm/my_wasm_file.wasm --gas auto --gas-prices $(archwayd q rewards estimate-fees 1 --node 'https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443' --output json | jq -r '.gas_unit_price | (.amount + .denom)') --gas-adjustment 1.4 --from <wallet-label> --chain-id archway-1 --node https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443 --broadcast-mode sync --output json -y
```


::

#title1
testnet

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd tx wasm store path_to_wasm/my_wasm_file.wasm --gas auto --gas-prices $(archwayd q rewards estimate-fees 1 --node 'https://rpc.constantine.archway.tech:443' --output json | jq -r '.gas_unit_price | (.amount + .denom)') --gas-adjustment 1.4 --from <wallet-label> --chain-id constantine-3 --node https://rpc.constantine.archway.tech:443 --broadcast-mode sync --output json -y
```
::

::
by replacing <**wallet-label**> with your own value.


The response from storing wasm will give you the Code ID required for instantiating the contract.

Then instantiate it:


::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
mainnet

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd tx wasm instantiate <code.id> '{"entrypoint":"value"}' --from <wallet-label> --label "A human readable label for this deployment" --gas auto --gas-prices $(archwayd q rewards estimate-fees 1 --node 'https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443' --output json | jq -r '.gas_unit_price | (.amount + .denom)') --gas-adjustment 1.4 --chain-id archway-1 --node https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443 --broadcast-mode sync --output json -y
```


::

#title1
testnet

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd tx wasm instantiate <code.id> '{"entrypoint":"value"}' --from <wallet-label> --label "A human readable label for this deployment" --gas auto --gas-prices $(archwayd q rewards estimate-fees 1 --node 'https://rpc.constantine.archway.tech:443' --output json | jq -r '.gas_unit_price | (.amount + .denom)') --gas-adjustment 1.4 --chain-id constantine-3 --node https://rpc.constantine.archway.tech:443 --broadcast-mode sync --output json -y
```

::

::


by replacing <**code-id**>, **{"entrypoint":"value"}**, <**wallet-label**> and
**"A human readable label for this deployment** with your own values.


The response from instantiating the contract will give you the Contract Address required for setting metadata on the contract instance.

Setting metadata on the contract instance:



::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
mainnet

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd tx gastracker set-contract-metadata <contract-address> '{ "owner_address": <admin-address>, "reward_address": <rewards-receiver-address>, "collect_premium": false, "premium_percentage_charged": 0, "gas_rebate_to_user": false }' --gas auto --gas-prices $(archwayd q rewards estimate-fees 1 --node 'https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443' --output json | jq -r '.gas_unit_price | (.amount + .denom)') --gas-adjustment 1.4 --from <wallet-label> --chain-id archway-1 --node https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443 --broadcast-mode sync --output json -y
```

::

#title1
testnet

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd tx gastracker set-contract-metadata <contract-address> '{ "owner_address": <admin-address>, "reward_address": <rewards-receiver-address>, "collect_premium": false, "premium_percentage_charged": 0, "gas_rebate_to_user": false }' --gas auto --gas-prices $(archwayd q rewards estimate-fees 1 --node 'https://rpc.constantine.archway.tech:443' --output json | jq -r '.gas_unit_price | (.amount + .denom)') --gas-adjustment 1.4 --from <wallet-label> --chain-id "constantine-3" --node https://rpc.constantine.archway.tech:443 --broadcast-mode sync --output json -y
```
::

::
by replacing <**contract-address**>, <**wallet-label**>, and <**admin-address**>, <**rewards-receiver-address**> and the other JSON values with your own values.



### Transaction filtering

Searching transactions with custom filters is a powerful feature. To do this we use the **tx** module with the **--events** filter. See below for common filtered queries that are helpful.

#### View all transactions to a specific contract:

Use filter key **wasm._contract_address**

Example:


::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
mainnet

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd query txs --events 'wasm._contract_address=<contract-address>' --node "https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443" --chain-id archway-1
```


::

#title1
testnet

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd query txs --events 'wasm._contract_address=<contract-address>' --node "https://rpc.constantine.archway.tech:443" --chain-id constantine-3
```


::

::
by replacing <**contract-address**> with your own value.

#### View all contracts deployed by a specific developer:

User filter keys **message.sender** and **message.action**

Example:


::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
mainnet

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd query txs --events 'message.sender=<developer-wallet-address>&message.action=/cosmwasm.wasm.v1.MsgInstantiateContract' --node https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443 --chain-id archway-1
```

::

#title1
testnet

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd query txs --events 'message.sender=<developer-wallet-address>&message.action=/cosmwasm.wasm.v1.MsgInstantiateContract' --node https://rpc.constantine.archway.tech:443 --chain-id constantine-3
```

::

::


by replacing <**developer-wallet-address**> with your own value.


### Code IDs and contract metadata:

Contract data and metadata queries use the **wasm** query module.

#### Find the Code ID of a specific contract:



::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
mainnet

#desc0
::highlight-card


```bash
archwayd query wasm contract <contract-address> --node https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443 --chain-id archway-1
```

::

#title1
testnet

#desc1
::highlight-card


```bash
archwayd query wasm contract <contract-address> --node https://rpc.constantine.archway.tech:443 --chain-id constantine-3
```


::

::

by replacing <**contract-address**> with your own value.


#### Check if a contract's code was ever updated:

by replacing <**contract-address**> with your own value.


::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
mainnet

#desc0
::highlight-card


```bash
archwayd query wasm contract-history <contract-address> --node https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443 --chain-id archway-1
```

::

#title1
testnet

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd query wasm contract-history <contract-address> --node https://rpc.constantine.archway.tech:443 --chain-id constantine-3
```


::

::
#### Find the contract address of a specific Code ID:

by replacing <**code-id**> with your own value.



::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
mainnet

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd query wasm list-contract-by-code <code-id> --node https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443 --chain-id archway-1
```

::

#title1
testnet

#desc1
::highlight-card
```bash
archwayd query wasm list-contract-by-code <code-id> --node https://rpc.constantine.archway.tech:443 --chain-id constantine-3
```
