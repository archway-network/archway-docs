# Developer Tools FAQs

In this section we address some common questions that developers using the archway tools may have.

## How can i limit a query to transactions sent from a specific address?

You can filter with the Archway daemon using the following: 


::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
mainnet

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd query txs --events 'wasm._contract_address=<contract-address>&message.sender=<address>' --node https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443
```
::

#title1
testnet

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd query txs --events 'wasm._contract_address=<contract-address>&message.sender=<address>' --node https://rpc.constantine-1.archway.tech:443
```

You can also filter based on the RPC API query using the following:




::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
mainnet

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io/tx_search?query=message.sender=<address>ANDmessage.action=/cosmwasm.wasm.v1.MsgInstantiateContract&order_by=desc 
```

::

#title1
testnet

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
https://rpc.constantine.archway.tech/tx_search?query=message.sender=<address>ANDmessage.action=/cosmwasm.wasm.v1.MsgInstantiateContract&order_by=desc 
```

## How can I query the bank module and filter for a particular action type?


You can use the **events** flag and filter events based on various actions, for example:




::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
mainnet

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd query txs --events 'message.action=/cosmos.bank.v1beta1.MsgSend' --node https://rpc.mainnet.archway.io:443

```
::

#title1
testnet

#desc1
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd query txs --events 'message.action=/cosmos.bank.v1beta1.MsgSend' --node https://rpc.constantine.archway.tech:443

```

## How can I convert an address from one network to another?	
You can get a network address from an address of a different network via Javascript using the CosmosJS library **@cosmjs/encoding** which you can find inside the arch3js. The following code snippet shows how to convert from a JUNO address to Archway:

::highlight-card
```javascript
import { fromBech32, toBech32 } from ""@cosmjs/encoding""

const { data } = fromBech32('juno1xxxyyy...')
const archwayAddress = toBech32('archway', data)"
```

## How can I query paginated data?
To query paginated data, append the **--page 1** flag to the command for the page you required, where 1 in this example signifies the first page. By default 100 records are returned per page.

## How can I output data in JSON format?

To output data in a JSON format, you can append the **--output "json"** flag to the command.
