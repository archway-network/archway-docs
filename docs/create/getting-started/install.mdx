# Installation

Make sure you've installed and configured a few dependencies.

#### Dependencies

- [Rustc](#rustc "Install Rust")
- [Cargo](#cargo "Install Cargo")
- [Cargo Generate](#cargo-generate "Install Cargo Generate")
- [wasm32](#wasm32 "Install wasm32")
- [Binaryen](#binaryen "Install Binaryen")
- [Archwayd](#archwayd "Install Archway Daemon")
- [Node.js](#nodejs-and-npm "Install Node.js and NPM")
- [Archway Developer CLI](#archway-developer-cli "Install develolper CLI")

#### Optional Dependencies

**IMPORTANT:** For local installations, you need root access to run `docker`. Make sure to follow all the steps with `root` access to prevent conflicts and confusions on the deployment process which requires root permission.

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker "Install Docker") (for Linux users, it's recommended to [run the Docker daemon in Rootless Mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/))

## Rustc

`rustc`, provided by the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/ "Rust Homepage") project maintainers, is the compiler for the Rust programming language. `rustc` takes your Rust source code and produces binary code as a library or an executable.

To install Rust, follow the instructions for your operating system at https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.

## Cargo

Cargo is the Rust package manager, like `go get` for Golang or `npm` is for JavaScript. Cargo comes with Rust if you installed `rustc` using `rustup`.

If you didn't install  `rustc` with `rustup`, or don't have `cargo` in your command line path, see the instructions for installing Cargo at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html.

## Cargo Generate

The `cargo-generate` tool creates a new Rust project quickly by leveraging a pre-existing code base.

Archway uses `cargo-generate` and `cargo-run-script` to provide and manage project templates for dapp development.

To install `cargo-generate` with `vendored-openssl`, and the `cargo-run-script` module, run the commands:

```bash
cargo install cargo-generate --features vendored-openssl
cargo install cargo-run-script
```

## wasm32

The `wasm32` [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) target is a 32-bit "bare wasm" module for producing [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) output that makes zero assumptions about your host machine and environment (hence the `-unknown-unkown` suffix). It's required by the [Developer CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@archwayhq/cli), as of version [`1.2.1`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@archwayhq/cli/v/1.2.1), for optimizing `wasm` output for on-chain storage of binaries.

Install `wasm32` using the following command:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

## Binaryen

As of version [`1.2.1`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@archwayhq/cli/v/1.2.1) of the [Developer CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@archwayhq/cli), [Binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen) replaces the need to use [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker) for optimizing `wasm` binaries for storage on-chain—allowing developers to run the [CosmWasm Rust Optimizer](https://github.com/CosmWasm/rust-optimizer) natively from the [Developer CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@archwayhq/cli).

### Building binaryen from source

To install `binaryen` clone the [git repository](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen) then initialize the submodules and update them:

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

After that you can build it with [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
```
cmake . && make
make install
```

:::tip
For building `binaryen` with gcc, you'll need [gcc-8](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-8/), or higher, in your path. Note that building with [gcc-7](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-7/), or lower, will fail with an `uknown option` or `unused variable` error.
:::

### Installing binaryen with Homebrew

MacOS users can install the [binaryen package](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/binaryen#default) from [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

```
brew install binaryen
```

## Archwayd

`archwayd` is an implementation of a Cosmos zone with `wasm` smart contracts enabled.

Originally forked from the [cosmos/gaia repository](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia), `archwayd` adds new modules for developer rewards and for executing `wasm`, but otherwise the `archwayd` binary functions just like `gaiad`.

To build `archwayd`, install it from source or use the `archwaynetwork/archwayd` [Docker](https://www.docker.com/ "Docker Homepage") container.

### Install Archwayd from Source

Get source code:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:archway-network/archway.git
cd archway
```

Build and install:

```bash
make install
```

:::info
**Note: Building archwayd from source requires Go 1.17+**
:::info

For full installation and configuration parameters, see https://github.com/archway-network/archway/blob/main/README.md.

### Install Archwayd Using Docker

Get source code:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:archway-network/archway.git
cd archway
```

Build and install:

```bash
docker build -t archway-network/archwayd:latest .
```

Or pull from Docker Hub:

```
docker pull archwaynetwork/archwayd:latest
```

:::tip
To simplify using the Docker container, set an alias with the home path and the proper image tag (replacing `<network-name>`), like:

```bash
alias archwayd="docker run --rm -it -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway archwaynetwork/archwayd:<network-name>"
```

After setting this alias, you can use the other `archwayd` commands without typing the verbose Docker run command.
:::

For more information on running `archwayd` with the `archway-network/archwayd` [Docker](https://www.docker.com/ "Docker Homepage") container, see  https://github.com/archway-network/archway#dockerized.

:::info
As of version [`1.2.1`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@archwayhq/cli/v/1.2.1) of the [Developer CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@archwayhq/cli) Docker is no longer a required dependency for optimizing smart contracts for upload to the blockchain.
:::


## Node.js and Npm

`npm` is a package manager for JavaScript and Node.js. Archway uses `npm` for installing and updating the developer CLI.

For installing `node.js` and `npm`, see instructions for your operating system at https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm.

:::info
`@archwayhq/cli` requires Node.js version 14 or higher, but some older versions in the `beta` release track required Node.js version 17. You can check which version you have installed using the command `archway --version`.

[See all availble versions of @archwayhq/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@archwayhq/cli?activeTab=versions)
:::

## Archway Developer CLI

Install the Archway developer CLI using `npm`, see [Downloading and installing Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

```bash
npm install -g @archwayhq/cli
```

:::caution
**Note:** If you are running `archwayd` using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker), and not running in [Rootless Mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/), you may need to install the Archway developer CLI as `root`, or give yourself permissions to the directory on your file system (for example, `sudo chown YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_GROUPNAME -R ~/.archway`).
