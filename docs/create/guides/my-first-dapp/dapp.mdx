# Building a dApp frontend

For building web frontends, you'll need the following [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) packages to connect your web page to Archway Network.

- [@cosmjs/stargate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cosmjs/stargate)
- [@cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate)

#### @cosmjs/stargate
`@cosmjs/stargate` is client library for the Cosmos SDK.

#### @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate
`@cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate` is an SDK to build CosmWasm clients. It extends `@cosmjs/stargate` with functionality for [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com/) contracts.


### Connecting to Archway

We’ll need our dApp to connect to users’ wallets with a browser extension like [Keplr](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap) wallet.

After installing the extension, you’ll notice Keplr is exposed to web pages as a property of the JavaScript window object of the active page.

Keplr also needs some metadata about the chain it’s connecting to, and the type of contracts stored there.
Here's the parameters you'll need to connect to Archway’s Constantine testnet and enable CosmWasm smart contracts.

```js
const ChainInfo = {
  chainId: "constantine-1",
  chainName: "Constantine Testnet",
  rpc: "https://rpc.constantine-1.archway.tech" ,
  rest: "https://api.constantine-1.archway.tech",
  stakeCurrency: {coinDenom: "CONST",coinMinimalDenom: "uconst",coinDecimals: 6},
  bip44: {coinType: 118},
  bech32Config: {bech32PrefixAccAddr: "archway",bech32PrefixAccPub: "archwaypub",bech32PrefixValAddr: "archwayvaloper",bech32PrefixValPub: "archwayvaloperpub",bech32PrefixConsAddr: "archwayvalcons",bech32PrefixConsPub: "archwayvalconspub"
  },
  currencies: [{coinDenom: "CONST",coinMinimalDenom: "uconst",coinDecimals: 6}],
  feeCurrencies: [{coinDenom: "CONST",coinMinimalDenom: "uconst",coinDecimals: 6}],
  coinType: 118,
  gasPriceStep: {low: 0,average: 0.1,high: 0.2},
  features: ['cosmwasm']
};
```

Now we can use `ChainInfo` to set up Keplr for Constantine testnet.

```js
import { SigningCosmWasmClient } from '@cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate';
import { GasPrice } from "@cosmjs/stargate";
 
let accounts, CosmWasmClient, queryHandler, gasPrice;

async function connectKeplrWallet() {
  if (window['keplr']) {
    if (window.keplr['experimentalSuggestChain']) {
      await window.keplr.experimentalSuggestChain()
      await window.keplr.enable(ChainInfo.chainId);
      const offlineSigner = await window.getOfflineSigner(ChainInfo.chainId);
      CosmWasmClient = await SigningCosmWasmClient.connectWithSigner(ChainInfo.rpc, offlineSigner);
     
      // This async waits for the user to authorize your dApp
      // it returns their account address only after permissions
      // to read that address are granted
      accounts = await this.offlineSigner.getAccounts();
 
      queryHandler = CosmWasmClient.queryClient.wasm.queryContractSmart;
      // Gas price
      gasPrice = GasPrice.fromString('0.002uconst');
 
      console.log('Wallet connected', {
        offlineSigner: offlineSigner,
        CosmWasmClient: CosmWasmClient,
        accounts: accounts,
        chain: ChainInfo,
        queryHandler: queryHandler,
        gasPrice: gasPrice
      });
    } else {
      console.warn('Error accessing experimental features, please update Keplr');
    }
  } else {
    console.warn('Error accessing Keplr, please install Keplr');
  }
};
```

## Querying the counter

In the previous step we saved a reference to `CosmWasmClient.queryClient.wasm.queryContractSmart`. We'll use it to query our `QueryMsg::GetCount` entrypoint of the Increment contract. 

Just like when we queried from CLI, we need to convert entrypoints to lowercase and snake case. In JavaScript the arguments become `{get_count: {}}`.

```js
const getCount = async () => {
  // Your contract address
  const ContractAddress = process.env.CONTRACT_ADDRESS;
  // Query arguments
  let entrypoint = {
    get_count: {}
  };
  // Do query type 'smart'
  let queryResult = await queryHandler.query(ContractAddress, entrypoint);
  console.log('GetCount Query', queryResult);
},
```

## Incrementing the counter
To broadcast transactions we call the `execute` function using our previous `CosmWasmClient` reference. We call this function with the following parameters:

1. **userAddress** - the address broadcasting the transaction
2. **ContractAddress** - the address of the contract the user is transacting with
3. **entrypoint** - arguments to be executed which match an entrypoint in the contract
4. **txFee** - transaction fees calculated by the `calculateFee` function from `@cosmjs/stargate`

We convert the case of entrypoint arguments to lowercase and snake case again, so `ExecuteMsg::Increment {}` from our Rust contract becomes `{increment: {}}` in our JavaScript.

```js
import { calculateFee } from "@cosmjs/stargate";

const incrementCounter = async () => {
  // Your contract address
  const ContractAddress = process.env.CONTRACT_ADDRESS;
  // Tx arguments
  let entrypoint = {
    increment: {}
  };
  // Gas fee estimation
  let txFee = calculateFee(300000, gasPrice);
  // Send Tx
  let tx = await CosmWasmClient.execute(userAddress, ContractAddress, entrypoint, txFee);
  console.log('Increment Tx', tx);
}
```

## Clone it and try yourself

You'll find working examples of dApp frontends for the Increment starter code template in the [dApp examples repository](https://github.com/archway-network/dApp-examples). Examples are given in both [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).
