# FAQ

Answers to frequently asked questions about Archway.

## What is Archway?

Archway is an incentivized smart contract chain for the Cosmos ecosystem that allows developers to deploy high-performance dApps and get rewarded for the value they contribute to the network.

## Why Archway?

When developers build and launch impactful dApps that generate usage on Archway, they can earn a proportional share of network fees and rewards. 

This shared earning model enables developers to potentially access recurring rewards and participate in the upside of the underlying protocol. 

Along with a more inclusive rewards model, Archway’s technical design is optimized for a seamless developer experience. 

The protocol provides a full WebAssembly (Wasm) implementation for cross-language support, a Web3-compatible API, and native bridges that connect to other networks for cross-chain communication and asset transfers.
